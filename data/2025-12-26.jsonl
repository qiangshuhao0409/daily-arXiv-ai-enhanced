While most existing studies focus on downlink and single-cell designs, the modeling and analysis of uplink RSMA under large-scale deployments remain largely unexplored. On the basis of stochastic geometry (SG), this paper introduces a unified analytical framework that integrates finite modulation and coding scheme (MCS)-based rate adaptation. This framework jointly captures spatial interference coupling and discrete rate behavior to bridge theoretical tractability and practical realism. Within this framework, we derive tractable expressions for the conditional received rate (CRR), its spatial average, and higher-order statistics via the meta distribution, thereby quantifying both the mean and user-specific rate performance. Results show that the proposed unified framework not only generalizes existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) analyses but also provides new insights into how discrete rate adaptation reshapes interference dynamics and fairness in dense RSMA-enabled networks."}

However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE."}

In contrast to the conventional approach using random variables, we can now perform conjunction, disjunction and implication of information, forming a Heyting algebra. Using the connection between Heyting algebra and intuitionistic logic, we can express the requirements of a communication network (e.g., network coding, index coding, Slepian-Wolf coding) as a logical formula, allowing us to use the hypergraph Heyting algebra to directly compute the optimal coding scheme. The optimal communication cost is simply given by the entropy of the hypergraph (within a logarithmic gap).

A Survey", "comment": null, "summary": "Privacy concerns around 5G, the latest generation of mobile networks, are growing, with fears that its deployment may increase exposure to privacy risks. This perception is largely driven by the use of denser deployments of small antenna systems, which enable highly accurate data collection at higher speeds and closer proximity to mobile users. At the same time, 5G's unique radio communication features can make the reproduction of known network attacks more challenging. In particular, passive network attacks, which do not involve direct interaction with the target network and are therefore nearly impossible to detect, remain a pressing concern. Such attacks can reveal sensitive information about users, their devices, and active applications, which may then be exploited through known vulnerabilities or spear-phishing schemes. This survey examines the feasibility of passive network attacks in 5G and beyond (B5G/6G) networks, with emphasis on two major categories: information extraction (system identification, website and application fingerprinting) and geolocation (user identification and position tracking). These attacks are well documented and reproducible in existing wireless and mobile systems, including short-range networks (IEEE 802.11) and, to a lesser extent, LTE. Current evidence suggests that while such attacks remain theoretically possible in 5G, their practical execution is significantly constrained by directional beamforming, high-frequency propagation characteristics, and encryption mechanisms. For B5G and early 6G networks, the lack of public tools and high hardware cost currently renders these attacks infeasible in practice, which highlights a critical gap in our understanding of future network threat models."}

The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness.

To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn."}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora."}

While existing approaches demonstrate high accuracy within single domains, they suffer from poor generalization due to domain shift phenomena. This paper presents a unified machine learning framework for cross domain elephant flow detection that incorporates application aware and security features to enhance robustness across diverse network environments. Our approach addresses the critical gap in existing literature by evaluating model performance across three distinct domains: Campus networks, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2018 datasets. This paper proposes a unified pipeline that employs adaptive thresholding, comprehensive feature engineering, and cross-domain evaluation to quantify and mitigate domain shift effects. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across domains (F1-scores ranging from 0.37 to 0.97), highlighting the importance of cross-domain validation. The unified model achieves an overall cross-validation F1 score of 0.99 while maintaining interpretability through feature importance analysis. Our findings reveal that while size based features dominate elephant flow detection (33.80% importance for total bytes), application-aware and security features contribute to improved classification accuracy and provide valuable insights for network management and security applications."}

Large-scale monitoring using WSNs incurs high costs due to the deployment of sensor nodes in the target deployment area. In this paper, we address the challenge of prohibitive deployment costs by proposing an integrated mixed-Integer linear programming (MILP) framework that strategically combines static and mobile Zigbee nodes. Our network planning approach introduces three novel formulations, including boundary-optimized static node placement (MILP-Static), mobile path planning for coverage maximization (MILP-Cov), and movement minimization (MILP-Mov) of the mobile nodes. We validated our framework with extensive simulations and experimental measurements of Zigbee power constraints. Our results show that boundary-optimized static placement (MILP-Static) achieves 53.06% coverage compared with 33.42% of the random approach. In addition, MILP-Cov for path planning reaches 97.95% coverage, while movement minimization (MILP-Mov) reduces traversal cost by 40%.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure.

To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes."}

We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio."}

However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an \"offline discovery, online matching\" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage.

In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\\%, 92.61\\%, and 99.83\\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%"}

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance."}

This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning."}

We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world."}

Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models."}

This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems."}

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution."}

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms."}

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts."}

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn."}

Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.\n  Index Terms--Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), 6G, Green Communication, Energy Efficiency, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Spectrum Sensing, RIS, Energy Harvesting, QoS, IoT."}

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks."}
