However, whether such beam focusing can fully eliminate\ninterference under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI),\nrendering advanced interference management schemes unnecessary, remains an open\nquestion. To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our\ntransmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD)\narchitecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation. A\nminimum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the\nanalog beamfocuser, the digital beamfocuser, and the common rate allocation. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal\nanalog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational\ncomplexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital\nbeamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore\nthat: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even\nunder perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA\nunder imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture\ndelivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio\nfrequency chains."}

Prior work has examined IPv6 status as a binary: can\nyou use IPv6, or not? As deployment increases we must consider a more nuanced,\nnon-binary perspective on IPv6: how much and often can a user or a service use\nIPv6? We consider this question as a client, server, and cloud provider.\nConsidering the client's perspective, we observe user traffic. We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons. First, IPv6 traffic is primarily human-generated,\nthus showing diurnal patterns. Second, some services are IPv6-forward and\nothers IPv6-laggards, so as users do different things their fraction of IPv6\nvaries. We look at server-side IPv6 adoption in two ways. First, we expand\nanalysis of web services to examine how many are only partially IPv6 enabled\ndue to their reliance on IPv4-only resources. Our findings reveal that only\n12.5% of top 100k websites qualify as fully IPv6-ready. Finally, we examine\ncloud support for IPv6. Although all clouds and CDNs support IPv6, we find that\ntenant deployment rates vary significantly across providers. We find that ease\nof enabling IPv6 in the cloud is correlated with tenant IPv6 adoption rates,\nand recommend best practices for cloud providers to improve IPv6 adoption.

In this work, we demonstrate that employing\nNPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we\nextend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,\nthe NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating\nfundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al.

The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\n  In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications.

Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large\npattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving\nheuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to\nexploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU\ncomputations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations\nin depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded\ndepth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of\nmodern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \\emph{Batch IDA*},\nan extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an\nextensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach\nused by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality\nguarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding\ntile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in\nDFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of\nhyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on\nperformance."}

In particular, honeybees mainly\nuse the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their\nvisual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a\nReinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only\noptic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained\nagents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base\ntheir motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most\nattention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with\nlarge optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently\ntrained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for\ndeveloping a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs."}

This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion.

In this work, we adopt\nChinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate\nrules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such\nenvironments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a\nlarge-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert\nannotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nXiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning\nfor legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating\nstrategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying\nreinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with\nmulti-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability.

Among the potential architectures,\nthe non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have\nreceived increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the\ndeployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves\nthe resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN\npresent new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,\nhindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native\nartificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in\ndisaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works\npropose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN\ndeployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a\nholistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps\nlifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses\nthe scalability challenges in NTN.

Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit\nhigh computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This\nlimits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to\nshort-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing\nNPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we\nextend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,\nthe NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating\nfundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al.
