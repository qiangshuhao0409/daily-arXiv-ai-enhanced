Demand-driven\nnavigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on\nimplicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,\ntraditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model\ntraining and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in\nunseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that\nemulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and\nslow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to\nfulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by\nsemantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.\nFurthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising\na Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that\nanalyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously\nimproves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the\ndecision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor\nsimulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view\ncamera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in\nnavigation accuracy and adaptability.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A\nlightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,\nsurpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency\nby nearly 50%.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems."}
