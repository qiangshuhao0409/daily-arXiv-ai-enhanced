However, limited\nspectrum often leads to severe uplink interference among ground terminals\n(GTs). In this paper, we investigate a rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled low-altitude MEC system, where a UAV-based edge server assists\nmultiple GTs in concurrently offloading their tasks over a shared uplink. We\nformulate a joint optimization problem involving the UAV 3D trajectory, RSMA\ndecoding order, task offloading decisions, and resource allocation, aiming to\nmitigate multi-user interference and maximize energy efficiency. Given the high\ndimensionality, non-convex nature, and dynamic characteristics of this\noptimization problem, we propose a generative AI-enhanced deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we embed a\ndiffusion model into the actor network to generate high-quality action samples,\nimproving exploration in hybrid action spaces and avoiding local optima. In\naddition, a priority-based RSMA decoding strategy is designed to facilitate\nefficient successive interference cancellation with low complexity.

By dynamically\nplacing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)\nconnections can be made to significantly improve system performance.

To address this issue, the robust\nresource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with\nuncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit\npower while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we\naddress the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position\nand obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method\ncombined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the\nmulti-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using\na particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting\nnon-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest.

But how close\nare they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can\ntackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific\nunderstanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn\naway from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on\nreal-life research problems.\n  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph\ntheory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of\nfrontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of\nreasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of\ncommercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,\nsuch as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is\ngenerated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)\nlogic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;\nideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately\nrelated to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central\nconjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As\nsuch, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known\nresults, could carry profound theoretical implications.\n  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on\nFormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts\nand explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from\nexpert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we\nadditionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from\nthe same distribution.
