Most existing works overlook such dynamics or ignore real-time\nconstraints on charging schedules. This paper presents a bandit-based charging\nframework for WP-IoT systems using mobile chargers with practical beamforming\ncapabilities and real-time charging constraints. We explicitly consider\ntime-varying channel state information (CSI) and impose a strict charging\ndeadline in each round, which reflects the hard real-time constraint from the\ncharger's limited battery capacity. We formulate a temporal-spatial charging\npolicy that jointly determines the charging locations, durations, and\nbeamforming configurations. Area discretization enables polynomial-time\nenumeration with constant approximation bounds. We then propose two online\nbandit algorithms for both stationary and non-stationary unknown channel state\nscenarios with bounded regrets.

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval"}

Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning\nboth open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals\nsubstantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning\nbenchmarks.

To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific\nmodel built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty\nestimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the\nscalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate\nthat the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time\nefficiency and exploration distribution."}

However,\ncurrent evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically\nanalyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within\nthese systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative\nprogrammable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this\nbenchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with\ntwo LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.\nThrough in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure\ncauses aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution\nissues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose\nactionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis\ncapabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides\nan empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous\nagent systems in the future."}
