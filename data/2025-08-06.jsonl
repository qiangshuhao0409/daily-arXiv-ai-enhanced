First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator\n(CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating\nmobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle\nmobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior.

However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on\ninstances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other\ndomains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic\nbenchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches."}

To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently\nambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system\nbehaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data\ndependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and\nhandle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code\ngeneration framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal\nspecifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating\ndecision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural\nrelationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously\neliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and\ndependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load\nassociated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy\nand efficiency."}

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable.

In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures.
