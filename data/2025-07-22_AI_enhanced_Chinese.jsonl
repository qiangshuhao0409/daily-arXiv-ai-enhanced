However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve.

However, the severe wireless signal attenuation in\nchallenging underground environments and the costly acquisition of channel\nstate information (CSI) make large-scale WPUCNs economically infeasible in\npractice. To address this challenge, we introduce flexible unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) into WPUCNs, leading to UAV-enabled WPUCN systems. In this\nsystem, a UAV is first charged by a terrestrial hybrid access point (HAP), then\nflies to the monitoring area to wirelessly charge UDs. Afterwards, the UAV\ncollects data from the UDs and finally returns to the HAP for data offloading.\nBased on the proposed UAV-enabled WPUCN system, we first propose its energy\nconsumption model and a hybrid wireless energy transfer (WET) approach (i.e.,\nUDs can harvest energy from both the HAP and the UAV) relying on full-CSI and\nCSI-free multi-antenna beamforming. Then, we formulate and address a time\nallocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of UAV, while ensuring\nthat the throughput requirements of all UDs are met and all sensor data is\noffloaded.

Unlike many existing works that heavily\nrely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical\napproach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind\nconfiguration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key\nfeatures of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS)\ndata via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a\nwindfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a\nnontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active\nsensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel\nestimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless\ncommunication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is\nthe RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is\nverified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band.

To address this, we introduce IBNBench, a\nfirst-of-its-kind benchmarking suite comprising four novel datasets:\nIntent2Flow-ODL, Intent2Flow-ONOS, FlowConflict-ODL, and FlowConflict-ONOS.\nThese datasets are specifically designed for evaluating LLMs performance in\nintent translation and conflict detection tasks within the industry-grade SDN\ncontrollers ODL and ONOS. Our results provide the first comprehensive\ncomparison of 33 open-source LLMs on IBNBench and related datasets, revealing a\nwide range of performance outcomes. However, while these results demonstrate\nthe potential of LLMs for isolated IBN tasks, integrating LLMs into a fully\nautonomous IBN pipeline remains unexplored. Thus, our second contribution is\nNetIntent, a unified and adaptable framework that leverages LLMs to automate\nthe full IBN lifecycle, including translation, activation, and assurance within\nSDN systems. NetIntent orchestrates both LLM and non-LLM agents, supporting\ndynamic re-prompting and contextual feedback to robustly execute user-defined\nintents with minimal human intervention. Our implementation of NetIntent across\nboth ODL and ONOS SDN controllers achieves a consistent and adaptive end-to-end\nIBN realization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86IBNBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u548cNetIntent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8633\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316IBN\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u610f\u56fe\u7f51\u7edc\uff08IBN\uff09\u4e2d\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u8bbe\u5907\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800cLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIBNBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1NetIntent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u975eLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316IBN\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "33\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728IBNBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cNetIntent\u5728ODL\u548cONOS\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7aef\u5230\u7aefIBN\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728IBN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cNetIntent\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316IBN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These findings suggest that\nwhile test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model\ncapabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.\nOur results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse\nreasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u6db5\u76d6\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6f14\u7ece\u548cAI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e94\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5fc3\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u653e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches enforce\nhalf-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling,\nlimiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel\nsampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency\nscenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array\ngains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two\ntechniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of\nactive RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to\n\\textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing\ntunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \\textit{eliminate} mutual\ncoupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing,\nunlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop\ngreedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity\nheuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array\nconfigurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a\nmultiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power\nconstraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder.

Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous,\nreciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is\nparamount.\n  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply\nsynergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a\nglobal semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven\nmechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation.\nThis fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural\nlearning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid\nscoring mechanism.

Efforts to detect and\nmitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while\ndata-plane signals remain largely overlooked. In particular, change in\npropagation delay caused by rerouting offers a promising signal: the change is\nunavoidable and the increased propagation delay is directly observable from the\naffected networks. In this paper, we explore the practicality of using delay\nvariations for hijack detection, addressing two key questions: (1) What\ncoverage can this provide, given its heavy dependence on the geolocations of\nthe sender, receiver, and adversary? and (2) Can an always-on latency-based\ndetection system be deployed without disrupting normal network operations?

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates.

P4TG is a P4-based traffic generator implemented for\nIntel Tofino switches that offers high-speed packet generation with\nfine-grained measurement capabilities. However, P4TG samples time-based metrics\nsuch as the round-trip time (RTT) in the data plane and collects them at the\ncontroller. This leads to a reduced accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a\nhistogram-based RTT measurement feature for P4TG. It enables accurate analysis\nat line rate without sampling. Generally, histogram bins are modeled as ranges,\nand values are matched to a bin. Efficient packet matching in hardware is\ntypically achieved using ternary content addressable memory (TCAM).

In this paper, we propose a stochastic geometry\nframework for the characterization of the potential benefits of the MN paradigm\nas part of an HetNet in urban settings. Our approach allows the estimation of\nuser-perceived performance, accounting for wireless backhaul connectivity as\nwell as base station resource scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem\nfor determining the resource-optimal network configurations and BS scheduling\nwhich minimize the overall amount of deployed BSs in a QoS-aware manner, and\nthe minimum vehicular flow between different urban districts required to\nsupport them, and we propose an efficient stochastic heuristic to solve it. Our\nnumerical assessment suggests that the MN paradigm, coupled with appropriate\ndynamic network management strategies, significantly reduces the amount of\ndeployed network infrastructure while guaranteeing the target QoS perceived by\nusers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MN\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HetNet\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MN\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc7\u989d\u5916\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u7ebf\u56de\u7a0b\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u57fa\u7ad9\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMN\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237QoS\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "MN\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faInsightX Agent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLMM\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u65e0\u635f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDMSD\u548cEGR\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728X\u5c04\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "InsightX Agent\u4ee5LMM\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8c03SDMSD\u548cEGR\u5de5\u5177\uff0cSDMSD\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u6848\uff0cEGR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728GDXray+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cInsightX Agent\u8fbe\u523096.35%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "InsightX Agent\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLMM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation.

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action.

We adapt cognitive science methodologies from\nhuman mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using\nTikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical\nadvantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly\nabove chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth\nMA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by\nprobing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models\nevaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with\nrandomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2).

Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system.

In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer\nnew possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain\nlimited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:\nEmergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic\nand interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective\nthought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract\nagent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means\nclustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by\na Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis.

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.
