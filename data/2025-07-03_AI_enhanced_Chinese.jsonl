Critics seized upon\nthe findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack\ngenuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.\nMeanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning\nthe experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify\nthis debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most\ncontentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing\nincremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that\npreviously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result\nof output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs\nstill stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the\nRiver Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to\nhinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to\nsolvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100\nagent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs\nare stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely\nunderstand.

To mitigate\ninter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages\nABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.\nSpecifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial\nbeamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs.

This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples.

While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric\ncomplex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may\nnot be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not\nsupported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by\ninvestigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary\namplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's\nsignals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the\nachievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK\nmodulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first\nderive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results\nreveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase\nof MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We\nthen formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting\nthe phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive\nthe optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an\nimprovement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is\nbetter than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate,\nespecially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the\nbackscatter link in SBC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff08MASK\u548cMPSK\uff09\u5728\u5171\u751f\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\uff08SBC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86PT\u548cBD\u7684\u901f\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PT\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbeBD\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3aCSCG\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672cBD\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff08MASK/MPSK\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86PT\u548cBD\u7684\u901f\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316MASK/MPSK\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u5927\u5316PT\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cBD\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347PT\u901f\u7387\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eMASK/MPSK\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u800cBD\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u4f4e\u9636ASK\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9636PSK\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316MASK/MPSK\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u53ef\u63d0\u5347PT\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f4e\u9636ASK\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f31\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u94fe\u8def\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and\ncomplexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original\nMDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing\ninsights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale\nnetwork.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u7ef4\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SP-MDGNN\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u7ef4\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SP-MDGNN\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08APs\uff09\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\uff08UEs\uff09\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165WMMSE\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f7b\u5fae\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}
