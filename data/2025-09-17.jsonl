In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

To\nthis end, in this paper, a unified framework that combines RL and optimization\ntheory is proposed to solve 0-1 mixed optimization problems in wireless\nnetworks. First, RL is used to capture the process of solving binary variables\nas a sequential decision-making task. During the decision-making steps, the\nbinary (0-1) variables are relaxed and, then, a relaxed problem is solved to\nobtain a relaxed solution, which serves as prior information to guide RL\nsearching policy.

The\nperformance bound and convergence guarantees of the proposed framework are then\nproven theoretically.
