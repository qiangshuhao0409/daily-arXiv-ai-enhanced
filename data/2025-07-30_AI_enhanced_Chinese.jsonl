These results demonstrate the\npromise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and\nexplainable RCA in network operation and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08RCA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08RCA\uff09\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165TeleLogs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u968f\u673a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLMs\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u7ef4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684RCA\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In parallel, we propose meta-alignment\nas the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override\ntriggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via\nthreshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop\ninvolving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured\nfeedback ingestion, including \"likes\", overrides, and abstentions.

The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites.

This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites.

However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,\nnecessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,\nexisting architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial\nLLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the\ncollaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster\ncollaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency\nmaximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For\nthe self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs\nwithin an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with\nhigh self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For\nthe cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the\nLLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask\nout the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the\npotential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented\nspecialties.

Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional.

We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency.

Therefore, we implemented\ninitial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve\nhonesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.\nOur data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6MoHoBench\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5f53\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b12k+\u6837\u672c\u7684MoHoBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf928\u79cd\u6d41\u884cMLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5f53\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4e14\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4fe1MLLMs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing research has\nlargely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical\ndriving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)\nand propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based\nretrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering\n(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale\nmultimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18\nsub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety\nqueries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,\nenabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of\nthe models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge\ngraph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel\nmulti-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.\nBy incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this\nframework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical\nsituations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream\nVLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves\nperformance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in\nCorner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five\nmainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and\nmethodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

We cast these problems in a\nformal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature\nestimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and\nprofiling jointly.

This paper\npresents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,\ncombining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning\ncapabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs\ndirectly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an\nexternal component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational\nproperties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm.
