Our key insight extends the\nclassical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise\nperturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured\nnoise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise\ndistributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization\neffects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with\nstandard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian\nchannel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,\nshowing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood\n(NLL).

However,\nthese models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in\nresponses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address\ntransparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI\napproaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are\nnot well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a\nlimited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively\nintegrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing\nestablished NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic\nintegration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with\nLLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four\ndimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These\ninclude symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,\narchitectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level\nperspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge\nadvancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for\nfuture research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in\nthe literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for\nsymbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency."}

The dataset is created by 25\nexperts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases\nto avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning\nbased automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just\nneeds to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently\nwithout any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three\nModules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the\nMathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code\ncorresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-\na small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling\nlanguage) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization\nbased Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described\nin the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of\ndeep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task\n(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric.

This critical oversight\ncauses unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,\neach specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the\nshared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis\nsolvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.\nSpecifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates\nVRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state\nspaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation\ninherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.\nFurthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating\nboth the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the\npolicy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension\nprovably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture\nfunction that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state\nembeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,\nwe introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes\nbasis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and\nimplements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism.

Co-Sight\naddresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable\nprocess through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification\n(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and\nauditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,\nsource-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout\nthe reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,\nwhere TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or\nreinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,\nCo-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last\nExam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).
