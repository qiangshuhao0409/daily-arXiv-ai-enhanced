In this paper, we exploit recently\nsynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to reduce the correlation between LEDs,\ni.e., the chiroptical properties of GNPs for differential absorption depending\non the azimuth angle of incident light are used to mitigate the LED\ncorrelation. In addition, we adopt a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\n(SLNR)-based precoder to support multiple users. The ratio of RGB light sources\nin each LED also needs to be optimized to maximize the sum SLNR satisfying a\nwhite light constraint for illumination since the GNPs can vary the color of\ntransmitted light by the differential absorption across wavelength. The\nnonconvex optimization problems for precoders and RGB ratios can be solved by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient with the approximated shot noise and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA).

We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that\nfilters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize\nprecision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our\ncompetitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research\n(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with\nenterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst\nturnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\\sim$3 hours ($\\sim$20x) for the\ncompetitive analysis."}

This letter proposes a\nhybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly\nimprove communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client\nclassification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data\ncontributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we\nformulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching\nantenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable\ncoupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm\nis developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate\nthe superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the\noptimized deployment of pinching antenna."}

Accepted and presented at The Fifth Intelligent\n  Cybersecurity Conference (ICSC 2025), nominated for Best Paper Award", "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach to time series classification using a\nMarkov Transition Field (MTF)-aided Transformer model, specifically designed\nfor Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The proposed model integrates the\ntemporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern\nrecognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's\nperformance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms\nbaseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments\ncommonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship\nbetween the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance,\neven with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training\nand inference times, making it an efficient solution for real-world SDN\napplications. These findings establish the potential of MTF-aided Transformers\nto address the challenges of time series classification in SDNs, offering a\npromising path for reliable and scalable analysis in scenarios with sparse\ndata."}

While existing alerting systems detect\nindividual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of\ncascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that\nindicates the urgency of issues \\emph{not solely by current impact, but by the\nprobability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both\ncurrent residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,\nnormalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables\noperators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60\nregions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks."}
