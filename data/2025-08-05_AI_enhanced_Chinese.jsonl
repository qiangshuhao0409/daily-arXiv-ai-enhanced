Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u65f6\u6bb5\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6536\u76ca\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u76ca\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Through these\ncontributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in\nthe principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and\noperations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the\ndefinition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u2018\u72b6\u6001\u2019\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u5206\u5c42\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u683c\u2019\u548c\u2018\u4e2d\u95f4\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u2018\u72b6\u6001\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u957f\u671f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6e05\u6670\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u5206\u5c42\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u683c\u2019\u548c\u2018\u4e2d\u95f4\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u81ea\u5f15\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8de8\u5b87\u5b99\u7406\u8bba\u81f3\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u5b9a\u4e49=\u72b6\u6001\u2019\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5143\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In contrast to the host-centric communication\napproach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing\nand routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance\nimprovements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of\ncoded data storage and transmission strategies.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design.

However, most prior work assumes a\npurely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially\nfragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the\nstudy of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein\nan adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the\ngraph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains\nunaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to\nthe inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection\nunder this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for\nplanted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection\nbecomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,\ndespite being possible in the classical random model.

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism.

I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses.

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss\nfunction calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while\nlearning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION\ndataset are designed to evaluate H2C.

An NLP-Based Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of\nthe plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated\nplans being 8.4 actions.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e92\u52a8\u6216\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5ba1\u8bae\u548c\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\uff09\u8fdb\u884c6,500\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u79f0\u51b3\u7b56\u6216\u538b\u529b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92.

To address this\nlimitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark\ncomprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to\nevaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and\nreproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate\nLiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and\n527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework\nthat enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task\nenvironments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose\nthe MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic\nplanning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool\nsuite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model\n(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate.

While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses\nreasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,\nwe find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading\nperformance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to\navoid impairing correctness.

We put special focus on estimating the\ndata density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced\ninterpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is\nraising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our\nproposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world\nEnvironmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and\nequitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of\nAmerica counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring\nequity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,\nwater quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the\nsociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables\nrelated to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe\nnegative impact on communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u654f\u611f\u6216\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982EPA\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u653f\u7b56\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Nevertheless,\ndiffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically\nsimilar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately\nimpairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for\ncomplex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO\n(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces\ndispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating\nall hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels\nthe network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,\nthereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences\nnecessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer\nregularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply\nenhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,\nD2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after\nfine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of\nreal-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high\nsuccess rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident\nin complex tasks.
