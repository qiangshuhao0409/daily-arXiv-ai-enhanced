This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.\n  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \\textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \\textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \\textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \\textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a \"Shared Context\" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems."}

To address this, the 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduced key uplink enhancements, including Uplink Multi-Input Multi-Output (UL-MIMO) and Uplink 256QAM, to improve throughput and spectral efficiency. However, while the benefits of these features for raw data rates are well-documented, their practical impact on real-time applications like live-streaming is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). To ensure a fair assessment, we conduct a comparative analysis by modifying the modem firmware of commercial User Equipment (UE), allowing these features to be selectively enabled and disabled on the same device. Performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including dropped video frames and connection stability. Furthermore, this study analyzes 5G Radio Frequency (RF) parameters to quantify the spectral efficiency impact, specifically examining metrics derived from the Channel State Information (CSI) framework, including Reference Signal Received Power (CSI-RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ), and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CSI-SINR)."}

With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.\n  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms."}

We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication."}

Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context."}

This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput.

While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to model uncertainty, they assume full state observability - an assumption that breaks down in partitioned DTNs, where each node operates with inherently partial knowledge of the network state. In this work, we investigate the role of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for DTN routing under uncertainty. We introduce and evaluate a novel model: Dependent Node Failures (DNF), which captures correlated node failures via repairable node states modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We implement the model using JuliaPOMDP and integrate it with DTN simulations via DtnSim. Our evaluation demonstrates that POMDP-based routing yields improved delivery ratios and delay performance under uncertain conditions while maintaining scalability.

The objective is to derive one-shot achievability results that can imply existing (first-order and second-order) asymptotic results when applied to memoryless sources and channels, or applied to systems with memory that behave ergodically.\n  Poisson functional representation was first proposed as a one-shot channel simulation technique by Li and El Gamal [118] for proving a strong functional representation lemma.

Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks."}

Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

In particular, we emphasize KD techniques specifically designed for wireless communication and mobile networking, such as channel-aware self-distillation, cross-model Channel State Information (CSI) feedback distillation, and robust modulation/classification distillation. Furthermore, we review novel architectures natively suited for KD and edge deployment, such as Mamba, RWKV (Receptance, Weight, Key, Value) and Cross-Architecture distillation, which enhance generalization capabilities. Subsequently, we examine diverse applications in which KD-driven architectures enable EGI across vision, speech, and multimodal tasks.

We analyze both the trade-off and the ratio between the achievable secrecy sum-rate and total power consumption. In the special case of two backscatter devices (BDs), we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal reflection coefficients and power allocation by exploiting the structure of the SEE objective and the Pareto boundary of the feasible set. When more than two BDs are present, the problem becomes analytically intractable. To address this, we propose two efficient optimization techniques: (i) an exhaustive grid-based benchmark method, and (ii) a scalable particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we design a deep learning-based predictor using a feedforward neural network (FNN), which closely approximates the optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the inclusion of AmBC significantly improves SEE, with gains up to 615% compared to conventional NOMA in high-noise regimes. Additionally, the FNN model achieves more than 95% accuracy compared to the optimal baseline, while reducing complexity. Finally, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the learned model, revealing that the most influential features correspond to the dominant composite channel components, in accordance with the theoretical system model. This demonstrates the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to build trust in energy-efficient and secure AmBC-NOMA systems for next-generation internet of things applications."}

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions."}

This paper addresses hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) against relay and user collusion in homogeneous networks, where each user connects to $n$ relays and each relay serves $m$ users. In the two-phase communication framework, users transmit masked data to relays, which then process and forward compiled messages to the server for exact sum recovery. The primary objective is to devise a transmission scheme such that the server can finish the aggregation task, while any group of $T_h$ colluding relays and $T_u$ colluding users cannot reveal any information about the data owned by the non-colluding users. In this study, we establish fundamental limits on the communication load, defined as the ratio of transmitted information size to original data size, for each user-relay link and each relay-server link. Achievable thresholds for collusion resilience are also derived. When the number of colluding relays and users falls below certain critical thresholds, we construct communication-optimal schemes using methods from network function computation. A limitation of these schemes is their reliance on large random keys. To address this, we derive a lower bound on the required key size and prove its achievability in cyclic networks, where users are connected to relays in a cyclic wrap-around manner. By establishing a connection between HSA and network function computation, this work advances the theoretical limits of communication efficiency and information-theoretic security in secure aggregation."}

Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models.

However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE)."}

This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions.

Our framework achieves up to 73 percent accuracy in task success detection and yields an average relative improvement of 27 percent in overall task success when evaluator feedback is applied. These results show that vision-based evaluation can serve as an effective feedback mechanism that improves the reliability and self-correction of autonomous computer-use agents."}

To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality."}

Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding."}

In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes.

It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics.

This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation."}

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam.

Existing detection frameworks, such as DE-COP, are computationally intensive, and largely inaccessible to independent creators. As legal scrutiny increases, there is a pressing need for a scalable, transparent, and user-friendly solution. This paper introduce an open-source copyright detection platform that enables content creators to verify whether their work was used in LLM training datasets. Our approach enhances existing methodologies by facilitating ease of use, improving similarity detection, optimizing dataset validation, and reducing computational overhead by 10-30% with efficient API calls. With an intuitive user interface and scalable backend, this framework contributes to increasing transparency in AI development and ethical compliance, facilitating the foundation for further research in responsible AI development and copyright enforcement."}

The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components. REACT (Requirements Engineering with AI for Consistency and Testing) employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between informal natural language requirements and formal specifications, enabling early verification and validation. SemaLens (Semantic Analysis of Visual Perception using large Multi-modal models) utilizes Vision Language Models (VLMs) to reason about, test, and monitor DNN-based perception systems using human-understandable concepts. Together, these components provide a comprehensive pipeline from informal requirements to validated implementations."}

We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication."}

This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.\n  Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \\textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \\textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \\textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \\textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a \"Shared Context\" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems."}

First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed."}
