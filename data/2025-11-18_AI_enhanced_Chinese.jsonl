However, their limited battery life and high energy consumption are very important challenges, especially in networked systems where multiple drones must communicate with a Ground Base Station (GBS). This study addresses these limitations by proposing the implementation of a bio-inspired leader-based energy management system for drone fleets. Inspired by bio-behavioral models, the algorithm dynamically chooses a single drone as a Leader in a cluster to handle long-range communication with the GBS, allowing other drones to preserve their energy. The effectiveness of the proposed bio-inspired algorithm is evaluated by varying network sizes and configurations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly increases network efficiency and service time by removing useless energy consumption communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9886\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e2a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u6709\u9650\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7ad9\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u65e0\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9886\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) integrated with wireless power transfer (WPT) technology emerge as a transformative paradigm, theoretically enabling unlimited operational lifetime. In this paper, we investigate a heterogeneous mobile charging architecture that strategically combines automated aerial vehicles (AAVs) and ground smart vehicles (SVs) in complex terrain scenarios to collaboratively exploit the superior mobility of AAVs and extended endurance of SVs for optimal energy distribution. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses the dynamic balance of heterogeneous charger advantages, charging efficiency versus mobility energy consumption trade-offs, and real-time adaptive coordination under time-varying network conditions. This problem presents significant computational challenges due to its high-dimensional continuous action space, non-convex optimization landscape, and dynamic environmental constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the improved heterogeneous agent trust region policy optimization (IHATRPO) algorithm that integrates a self-attention mechanism for enhanced complex environmental state processing and employs a Beta sampling strategy to achieve unbiased gradient computation in continuous action spaces. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that IHATRPO achieves a 39% performance improvement over the original HATRPO, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline algorithms while substantially increasing sensor node survival rate and charging system efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIHATRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u79fb\u52a8\u5145\u7535\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u5145\u7535\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u548c\u5145\u7535\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u7ebf\u53ef\u5145\u7535\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5f02\u6784\u5145\u7535\u5668\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Beta\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "IHATRPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbHATRPO\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534739%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u548c\u5145\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6784\u79fb\u52a8\u5145\u7535\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eIHATRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations.

A specialized corpus of negative news headlines was created using tailored prompts to capture diverse negative sentiments across various societal domains. The synthetic headlines were validated by expert review and further analyzed in embedding space to assess their alignment with real-world negative news in terms of content, tone, length, and style. Key metrics such as correlation with real headlines, perplexity, coherence, and realism were evaluated. The synthetic dataset was benchmarked against two sets of real news headlines using evaluations including the Comparative Perplexity Test, Comparative Readability Test, Comparative POS Profiling, BERTScore, and Comparative Semantic Similarity.

Rashmi"], "title": "Tight Lower Bounds on the Bandwidth Cost of MDS Convertible Codes in the Split Regime", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in erasure coding for distributed storage systems have demonstrated that adapting redundancy to varying disk failure rates can lead to substantial storage savings. Such adaptation requires code conversion, wherein data encoded under an initial $[k^I + r^I, k^I]$ code is transformed into data encoded under a final $[k^F + r^F, k^F]$ code - an operation that can be resource-intensive. Convertible codes are a class of codes designed to facilitate this transformation efficiently while preserving desirable properties such as the MDS property. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits on the bandwidth cost of conversion (total amount of data transferred between the storage nodes during conversion) for systematic MDS convertible codes. Specifically, we study the subclass of conversions known as the split regime (a single initial codeword is converted into multiple final codewords).\n  In this setting, prior to this work, the best known lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion for all parameters were derived by Maturana and Rashmi under certain uniformity assumptions on the number of symbols downloaded from each node. Further, these bounds were shown to be tight for the parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq r^F$. In this work, we derive lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of systematic MDS convertible codes for all parameters in the split regime without the uniformity assumption. Moreover, our bounds are tight for the broader parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq k^F$.

However, this transition is hindered by fundamental limitations in conventional metasurface transmitter architectures, including restricted modulation orders, symbol-level spatial inconsistency, and significant harmonic interference. These issues stem from the intrinsic coupling between baseband signal processing and radio-frequency beamforming in monolithic designs reliant on simplistic switching mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA) that fundamentally decouples these functionalities. The MSA introduces a dual-stage up-conversion process, comprising a digital up-conversion module for in-phase/quadrature modulation and baseband-to-intermediate frequency conversion, a precoder module for precoding, and a custom-designed magnitude-phase-decoupled metasurface that acts as a reconfigurable reflective mixer array. This decoupling of harmonic-free waveform generation from spatial precoding overcomes the critical drawbacks of existing approaches. Experimental results from a 5.8 GHz proof-of-concept prototype system validate the MSA's superior performance. The system generates spatially isotropic constellations for arbitrary-order QAM modulations, ensures consistent time-frequency signatures for applications like Doppler-spoofing, and achieves data rates up to 20 Mbps within a linear operating region that minimizes nonlinear distortion. The capability of employing spatial diversity and multi-stream interference cancellation has been demonstrated for the first time in a PM-based transmitter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8d85\u5916\u5dee\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8c03\u5236\u9636\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5e72\u6270\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8c10\u6ce2\u81ea\u7531\u6ce2\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8c03\u5236\u9636\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u8c10\u6ce2\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u57fa\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5c04\u9891\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8026\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u4e0a\u53d8\u9891\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u5b57\u4e0a\u53d8\u9891\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8eI/Q\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u5e26\u5230\u4e2d\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6-\u76f8\u4f4d\u89e3\u8026\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u53cd\u5c04\u6df7\u9891\u5668\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MSA\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u9636QAM\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u661f\u5ea7\u56fe\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6b3a\u9a97\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe20 Mbps\u7684\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5728PM\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6d41\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MSA\u67b6\u6784\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This \"hallucination\" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.\n  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations.

Veeravalli"], "title": "Finite-Horizon Quickest Change Detection Balancing Latency with False Alarm Probability", "comment": "27 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Sequential Analysis", "summary": "A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection (QCD) problem that is of relevance to learning in non-stationary environments is studied. The metric characterizing false alarms is the probability of a false alarm occurring before the horizon ends. The metric that characterizes the delay is \\emph{latency}, which is the smallest value such that the probability that detection delay exceeds this value is upper bounded to a predetermined latency level. The objective is to minimize the latency (at a given latency level), while maintaining a low false alarm probability. Under the pre-specified latency and false alarm levels, a universal lower bound on the latency, which any change detection procedure needs to satisfy, is derived.

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity.

This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large.

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision.

Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability.

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks.

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u73b0\u6709NL-FOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u660e\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aFOL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709NL-FOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u534f\u8bae\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684NL-FOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-4.1-Mini\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cdLLM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5728RAVEN-FAIR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SSIM\u548cLPIPS\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5206\u6570\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "GPT-4.1-Mini\u5728\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5e73\u8861\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4f7f\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE.

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5185\u7a0e\u6536\u6cd5\u5178\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u3002\u7a0e\u6536\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u5c06\u7a0e\u6cd5\u6761\u6b3e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aProlog\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728SWISH\u4e2d\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6d4b\u8bd5Prolog\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408Prolog\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7531GPT-5\u6307\u5bfc\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u6216Prolog\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0833%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002\u800c\u6df7\u5408Prolog\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22(DDR)\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e93\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u58f0\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e93\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e93\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u68c0\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa50\u4e07+\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6DDR\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DDR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u914d\u5907DDR\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDR\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u58f0\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5.

For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO).

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement.

State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard classification irreversibly loses critical information: specifically, the quantifiable subtle differences between information sets-vital for strategy solving-thereby compromising the quality of such solving. Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Embedding CFR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u7c7b\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u6251\u514b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u6027\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u5206\u7c7b\u4f1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u4e22\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u6c42\u89e3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEmbedding CFR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5c06\u5b64\u7acb\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9057\u61be\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6251\u514b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\uff0cEmbedding CFR\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u53ef\u5265\u524a\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u6251\u514bAI\u4e2d\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u62bd\u8c61\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u522b\u548c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B.

Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift.

While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DRedMTL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eDatalogMTL\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u91cd\u65b0\u7269\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684DatalogMTL\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178DRed\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406DatalogMTL\u7269\u5316\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDRedMTL\u901a\u5e38\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u7269\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "DRedMTL\u4e3aDatalogMTL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark.

While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design.

We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition.

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mobile-Agent-RAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42UI\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6Mobile-Agent-RAG\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u53cc\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Manager-RAG\u68c0\u7d22\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5168\u9762\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6218\u7565\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Operator-RAG\u68c0\u7d22\u6700\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5bfc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMobile-Agent-RAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611.0%\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "Mobile-Agent-RAG\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79fb\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research.

RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RGR-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.4%-8.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u9886\u57df\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4e14\u7eaf\u5728\u7ebfRL\u6846\u67b6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRGR-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8ba9LLM\u83b7\u5f97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5927\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u4e2a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRGR-GRPO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u66ff\u4ee3\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848\u6216\u79bb\u7ebf\u6307\u5bfc\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.0%\u30015.4%\u30018.4%\u548c6.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "RGR-GRPO\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u71b5\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684pass@k\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7406\u6027\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u662fAI\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u975e\u7406\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5957\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u4ece\u672a\u77e5\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8870\u51cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) CR\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u5408\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b(2) \u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u80fd\u591f\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9650\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u534f\u52a9\u3002"}}

First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs.

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARCHE\u4efb\u52a1\u548cARCHE Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u6811\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u90fd\u660e\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u6216\u6eaf\u56e0\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3010\u4e2a\u9886\u5148LLMs\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals.

Our empirical evaluation of state compression techniques for grounded and lifted planning on classical and numeric planning tasks reveals compression ratios of several orders of magnitude, often with negligible runtime overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6811\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u547d\u9898\u548c\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9759\u6001\u7248\u672c\u4f18\u826f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u548c\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6811\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u867d\u7136\u6bcf\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6052\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6811\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u547d\u9898\u548c\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8fbe\u5230\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u6811\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space.

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics.

This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u536b\u661f\u96c6\u7fa4\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4ece\u5355\u536b\u661f\u5230\u591a\u536b\u661f\u573a\u666f\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eBasilisk\u548cBSK-RL\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30MAPPO\u3001HAPPO\u3001HATRPO\u7b49\u5148\u8fdbMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "MARL\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u50cf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u536b\u661f\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively.

Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability.

Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Yanyun-3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u7b56\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1163%\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06BLEU-4\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534712.98\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b56\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6218\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u7b56\u7565\u6e38\u620f\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210Qwen2.5-VL\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548cUI-TARS\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c4f\u5e55\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u878d\u5408\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u540c\u65f6\u6df7\u5408\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u878d\u5408\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1163%\uff0cBLEU-4\u5206\u6570\u4ece4.81%\u63d0\u5347\u81f362.41%\uff08\u7ea612.98\u500d\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps.

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GEM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f18\u52bf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5019\u9009\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5f15\u5165token\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u5bf9CoT\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u52a0\u6743\uff1b2.

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e94\u7528\u4e03\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u662f\u975e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u7684transformer\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7f16\u7801\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u7684\u6709\u5bb3transformer\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c42\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity.

Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results.

A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "STEP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u4e2d\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u88ab\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTEP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7ef4\u62a4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8bb0\u5f55\u6307\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u529f\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u6837\u672c\uff1b4\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7GRPO\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728OSWorld\u548cAndroidWorld\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTEP\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7GRPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "STEP\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "DALA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u89c6\u4e3a\u7a00\u7f3a\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ade\u6807\u53d1\u8a00\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d'\u81ea\u7531\u653e\u4efb'\u901a\u4fe1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7token\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6311\u6218'\u66f4\u591a\u901a\u4fe1\u603b\u662f\u66f4\u597d'\u7684\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u62cd\u5356\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53(DALA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u62cd\u5356\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ade\u6807\u53d1\u8a00\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u4ea7\u751f\u7b80\u6d01\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1aMMLU 84.32%\uff0cHumanEval 91.21% pass@1\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528625\u4e07token\uff0c\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "DALA\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u57f9\u517b\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u6027\u6c89\u9ed8\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4ece\u5197\u957f\u5230\u6c89\u9ed8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule.

In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order.

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency.

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679032\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u8f66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u4e8e\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u603b\u71b5\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u548cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5d4c\u5165\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8632\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u57289\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7535\u8f66\u95ee\u9898\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8c\u5143\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u603b\u71b5\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7'\u4e22\u5f03'\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5927\u4e8e\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5185\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u603b\u71b5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles.

In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements.

Beyond safety, these models must also be able to reflect the diverse range of human values across various cultures. This paper presents the Cultural Norm-based Cultural Alignment (CNCA) framework, which enables models to leverage their powerful reasoning ability to align with cultural norms. Specifically, we propose three methods to automatically mine cultural norms from limited survey data and explore ways to effectively utilize these norms for improving cultural alignment. Two alignment paradigms are examined: an in-context alignment method, where cultural norms are explicitly integrated into the user context, and a fine-tuning-based method, which internalizes norms through enhanced Chain-of-Thought training data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting that models with stronger reasoning capabilities benefit more from cultural norm mining and utilization. Our findings emphasize the potential for reasoning models to better reflect diverse human values through culturally informed alignment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6CNCA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6316\u6398\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b89\u5168\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCNCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6587\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002"}}

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86transformer\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6cdb\u5316-\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u88ab\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e2d\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u518d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u65b9\u5411\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u4f46\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "transformer\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c31\u7cfb\uff1a\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5851\u9020\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $\u03ba$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents.

However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting.

We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency.

Accepted at AI4RWC@WI-IAT 2025", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern healthcare by advancing disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and biomedical research. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u533b\u7597\u6307\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6307\u5357\u548c\u6587\u732e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u5357\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6307\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a0\u901fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u533b\u7597\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback.

Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization.
