However, implementing distributed tracing in\nlarge-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive\ninstrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions,\nsuch as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected\nwithout modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the\nprocess of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical\nchallenge in zero-code approaches.

Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity.
