However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits.

This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method.

This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience.

Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u661f\u5ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4f20\u64ad\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u5e03\u5c40\u5f88\u5c11\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5206\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f4\u5f84\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u6216\u52a0\u5f3a\u94fe\u8def\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u76f4\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684ISL\u914d\u7f6e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u4e2a\u8f68\u9053\u5468\u671f\u7684\u94fe\u8def\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u76f4\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272ISL\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u8df3\u6570\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u94fe\u8def\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation.

Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive.

Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks.

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity).

In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eff\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5343\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u673a\u52a8\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f16\u961f\u884c\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u9762\u4e34\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u7f16\u961f\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u5206\u7ec4\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u8def\u7531\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u4eff\u751f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u9e3d\u5b50\u5f0f\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u95f4\u690b\u9e1f\u5f0f\u907f\u969c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u673a\u52a8\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f16\u961f\u884c\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "BINC\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u961f\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained.

While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.\n  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.\n  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads.

In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u548cVLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5371\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u591a\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5982\u4e66\u9762\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u73b0\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u5371\u9669\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528GPT 4o\u548cGPT 4o mini\u4ece28,000\u4efdOSHA\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c1\u89e3\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528Molmo 7B\u548cQwen2 VL 2B\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff0c\u5728ConstructionSite10k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0cMolmo 7B\u548cQwen2 VL 2B\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning.

These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f39\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u63d0\u5347\u6982\u5ff5\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9e3f\u6c9f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u63d0\u5347\u6982\u5ff5\u5224\u65ad\u9898\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf(MAS)\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cMAS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u548cMAS\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response.

Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels.

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence.

Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps.

Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts.

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates.

Huertas", "Pascal Van Hentenryck"], "title": "An Aligned Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation.

This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable.

To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MR-RML\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7GPRC\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6807\u51c6\u5bfc\u5411\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6743\u5a01\u533b\u7597\u57fa\u51c6Healthbench\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u8131\u8282\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u7ef4\u533b\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMR-RML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u5c06\u533b\u7597\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\"\u7ef4\u5ea6-\u573a\u666f-\u5b66\u79d1\"\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2) \u72ec\u7acb\u591a\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b3) \u5c06\u533b\u7597\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u53c2\u8003\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Healthbench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bQwen-32B\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534745%\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534785%\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u5b50\u96c662.7\u5206\uff0c\u56f0\u96be\u5b50\u96c644.7\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MR-RML\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533b\u7597\u6807\u51c6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams.

Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u91cd\u8981\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u652f\u67f1\uff1a(1) LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b(2) \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff1b(3) \u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5c06\u52a0\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5173\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6210\u529f\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u6027\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators.

We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement.

These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy.

The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6d88\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u96c6\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08\u8bca\u6240\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u4e13\u79d1\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u540d\u5316\u75c5\u4f8b\u4ee4\u724c\u3001\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u627e\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Orpius\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7OperationRelay\u8c03\u7528\u4ea4\u6362\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u63a5\u6536\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u8003\u91cf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pharos-ESG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ESG\u62a5\u544a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d9\u8ff0\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u89e3\u51b3ESG\u62a5\u544a\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u4e71\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "ESG\u62a5\u544a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u4e71\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u957f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5f31\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c40\u6d41\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u7531\u76ee\u5f55\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u805a\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPharos-ESG\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86Aurora-ESG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5f00\u7684ESG\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Pharos-ESG\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ESG\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684ESG\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness.

While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.", "AI": {"tldr": "PersonaDrift\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u65e5\u5e38\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u60c5\u611f\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u4e24\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005(PLwD)\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5927\u591a\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u79cd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8bbf\u8c08\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df60\u5929\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u60c5\u611f\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f4e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cPersonaDrift\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u610f\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u529b\u5ea6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e14\u4e2a\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u610f\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMarr\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u8bc6\u522b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u4e09\u79cd\u529b\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6027\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4e8614\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u54f2\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u8457\u540d\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u610f\u8bc6\u8fa9\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u6f84\u6e05\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u70b9\u3002"}}

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design\". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies.

Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning.

Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability.

To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.

We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b28\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8617\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe60%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u5374\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa28\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u679017\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u768417\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c54\u6761\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c1,598\u7bc7LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5143\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5173\u6ce8\u6613\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe60%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548cLLM\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u8106\u5f31\u4f2a\u63a8\u7406\u6377\u5f84\u6216\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
