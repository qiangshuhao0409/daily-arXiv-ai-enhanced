In this paper, we\nstart from the observation that constrained IoT devices have largely different\nhardware (im-)balances than full-scale machines. We find that the performance\ngap between MCU and network throughput on constrained devices enables minimal\nenergy delay product (EDP) for IoT networking at largely reduced clock\nfrequencies. We analyze the potentials by integrating dynamic voltage and\nfrequency scaling (DVFS) into the RIOT IoT operating system and show that the\nDVFS reconfiguration overhead stays below the energy saved for a single,\ndownscaled MAC operation. Backed by these findings, we systematically\ninvestigate how DVFS further improves energy-efficiency for common networking\ntasks -- in addition to duty-cycling. We measure IoT communication scenarios\nbetween real-world systems and analyze two MAC operating modes -- CSMA/CA and\ntime slotting -- in combination with different CoAP transactions, payload\nsizes, as well as DTLS transport encryption. Our experiments reveal energy\nsavings between 24% and 52% for MAC operations and up to 37% for encrypted CoAP\ncommunication.

To\nevaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received\nsignal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of\nsurfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a\nposition-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results\ndemonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant\nadvantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two\nconfigurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a\nmultiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics\northogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the\nradiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design\nprocess more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the\nobjective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing\nthe active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients,\nsubject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the\nresulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm\nthat alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active\nbeamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the\nspherical harmonics coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed\npattern-reconfigurable FRIS significantly outperforms traditional RIS\narchitectures based on the 3GPP 38.901 and isotropic radiation models,\nachieving average performance gains of 161.5% and 176.2%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u6d41\u4f53\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08FRIS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6d41\u4f53\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u77ac\u65f6\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6d41\u4f53\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u8868\u9762\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\uff08SHOD\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u6d41\u4f53\u5143\u4ef6\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u7403\u8c10\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u91cd\u6784FRIS\u57283GPP 38.901\u548c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86161.5%\u548c176.2%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u91cd\u6784FRIS\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To mitigate the resulting\ninterference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a\nlow-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution\ncharacteristics of ICI. {Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit\nerror rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to\nconventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is\ncapable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the\nproposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed\nsoft ID scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u4eff\u5c04\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\uff08nAFDM\uff09\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eIDFT\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f6f\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793anAFDM\u5728BER\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eIDFT\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8f6f\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "nAFDM\u5728BER\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfAFDM\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0BER\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "nAFDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

During network analysis, test\nfiles such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if\npresent in the system that must be resolved for better overall network\nperformance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current\nmethods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the\nfaults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine\ndesigned to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically\nwithin the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural\nlanguage processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies,\nsignificantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The\nFA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine\nexplains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents\nsuch as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions\nof the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy\non the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and\nfailed PCAP files.

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The\nexperimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the\nreliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding\ncan guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the\nrefinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with\nmultiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are\nnot necessarily the most stable.

Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator\nAgent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective\noptimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then\ndeployed to Open and AI RAN controllers.

The prior works have studied its performance at fixed\nsites and in-motion vehicles, while an in-depth analysis of in-flight\nperformance remains absent. With major airlines now offering Starlink Internet\nonboard, there is a growing need to evaluate and improve its performance for\naviation users. This paper addresses this shortcoming by conducting in-flight\nmeasurements over the Baltic Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Our measurement results\nshow that a single user device experiences median throughputs of 64 Mbps and 24\nMbps for the downlink and uplink, respectively. The median uplink throughput is\napproximately 33 Mbps when the aircraft maintains an altitude above 17,000\nfeet. However, a significant reduction in uplink performance is observed during\nthe aircraft descent phase, with the median throughput dropping to around 20\nMbps at lower altitudes. Round-trip time (RTT) is highly dependent on the\nlocation of the ground station being pinged and the use of inter-satellite\nlinks (ISLs). We dive deeper into 5.5 hours of ping measurements collected over\nthe Pacific Ocean and investigate factors influencing RTT, hypothesizing that\nISLs routing, data queuing at satellites, and feeder link congestion contribute\nto deviations from theoretical values. For comparative analysis, we evaluate\nthe Starlink ground terminal and in-flight connectivity performance from the\nperspectives of a residential user and an airline passenger, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Starlink\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u822a\u73ed\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9bStarlink\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce2\u7f57\u7684\u6d77\u548c\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u4e0a\u7a7a\u8fdb\u884c\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u6d4b\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4e0b\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e3a64 Mbps\uff0c\u4e0a\u884c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e3a24 Mbps\uff1b\u5728\u98de\u673a\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e0a\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002RTT\u53d7\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86Starlink\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}
