Current AI evaluation practices\ndepend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to\nmeasure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.\nThis research addresses the urgent need to quantify this \"benchmark-regulation\ngap.\" We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses\nvalidated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from\nwidely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities\nand propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation\necosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,\nsuch as \"Tendency to hallucinate\" (53.7% of the corpus) and \"Discriminatory\nbias\" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously\nneglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,\nincluding evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI\ndevelopment, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This\ntranslates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like \"Loss of\nControl\" (0.4% coverage) and \"Cyber Offence\" (0.8% coverage). This study\nprovides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering\ncritical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to\nbuild the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and\nmore compliant AI."}

However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets\nface numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent\nsubjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically\nexpensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data\ngeneration--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,\nresource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with\ndiverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We\ngenerate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We\nevaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for\nERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our\nexperimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the\ngenerated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve\nstatistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks."}

However, enhancing these capabilities through\npost-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and\ncomputational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample\nefficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on\nheuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we\nintroduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework\nthat integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of\nInfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates\nhigh-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using\nmultidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance\ngains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to\nnew data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model\nachieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only\napproximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization\nacross diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through\nthe application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical\nreasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME\n24/25 benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval\nAugmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with\nlarge-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL\nintegrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a\ndata synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is\nautomatically generated for each task.

Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our\nframework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA\nand BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement\nto human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,\nrespectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline.

To address these challenges, we\npropose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection\ngating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles\nfour complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a\nmodality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse\ninterpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents\nrefine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and\nefficiency.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints."}

Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior."}
