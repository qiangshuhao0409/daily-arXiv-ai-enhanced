Abstract: Incentive-driven computing resource sharing is crucial for meeting the
ever-growing demands of emerging mobile applications. Although conventional
spot trading offers a solution, it frequently leads to excessive overhead due
to the need for real-time trading related interactions. Likewise, traditional
futures trading, which depends on historical data, is susceptible to risks from
network dynamics. This paper explores a dynamic and uncertain edge network
comprising a computing platform, e.g., an edge server, that offers computing
services as resource seller, and various types of mobile users with diverse
resource demands as buyers, including fixed buyers (FBs) and uncertain
occasional buyers (OBs) with fluctuating needs. To facilitate efficient and
timely computing services, we propose an overbooking- and hybrid
trading-empowered resource scheduling mechanism with reputation update, termed
Oh-Trust. Particularly, our Oh-Trust incentivizes FBs to enter futures trading
by signing long-term contracts with the seller, while simultaneously attracting
OBs to spot trading, enhancing resource utilization and profitability for both
parties. Crucially, to adapt to market fluctuations, a smart reputation
updating mechanism is integrated, allowing for the timely renewal of long-term
contracts to optimize trading performance. Extensive simulations using
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Oh-Trust across multiple
evaluation metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi 7的MLO虽然提供了并行性和容量优势，但在保证严格延迟边界和优化异构流量QoS方面仍面临挑战，主要受限于静态EDCA参数和跨链路流量管理的复杂性。

Method: 分析了MLO QoS指标与EDCA参数配置及AC流量分配之间的相关性，构建了约束优化问题，设计了基于遗传算法的MLO EDCA QoS优化算法来搜索复杂的配置空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效生成适应不同服务需求的自适应MLO配置策略，显著改善延迟分布特性，在高负载MLO环境中增强QoS鲁棒性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 提出的基于遗传算法的优化方案能够有效解决MLO环境下的QoS保障问题，为Wi-Fi 7多链路操作提供了实用的服务质量优化方法。

Abstract: IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) as a While MLO
offers significant parallelism and capacity, realizing its full potential in
guaranteeing strict delay bounds and optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) for
diverse, heterogeneous traffic streams in complex multi-link scenarios remain a
significant challenge. This is largely due to the limitations of static
Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) parameters and the complexity
inherent in cross-link traffic management. To address this, this paper
investigates the correlation between overall MLO QoS indicators and the
configuration of EDCA parameters and Acess Catagory (AC) traffic allocation
among links. Based on this analysis, we formulate a constrained optimization
problem aiming to minimize the sum of overall packet loss rates for all access
categories while satisfying their respective overall delay violation
probability constraints. A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based MLO EDCA QoS
optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently search the complex
configuration space of AC assignments and EDCA parameters. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach's efficacy in generating adaptive MLO
configuration strategies that align with diverse service requirements. The
proposed solution significantly improves delay distribution characteristics,
and enhance QoS robustness and resource utilization efficiency in high-load MLO
environments.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数字孪生的用户中心通信服务方案，用于6G网络中边缘辅助移动增强现实应用，通过自适应数据流量建模和资源管理，提升相机帧上传的及时性。

Motivation: 6G网络需要支持移动增强现实应用，但用户特定的非平稳上行数据流量给设备姿态跟踪带来了挑战，需要更智能的通信服务方案。

Method: 构建了针对MAR的定制化数据模型，定义了两个数字孪生操作函数来自适应切换数据驱动模型，提出了基于数字孪生的网络资源管理算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比5G中广泛使用的切片式通信服务方案，所提方法在满足相机帧上传延迟要求方面提升了14.2%。

Conclusion: 基于数字孪生的用户中心通信服务能够有效应对MAR应用中非平稳数据流量的挑战，确保帧上传的及时性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile
augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices
and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices
must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to
cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a
digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service
provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices,
we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate
impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data
traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively
enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing
non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management
introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that
ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent
inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven
simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service
provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay
requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service
provision widely used for 5G.

Abstract: OpenID Connect for Agents (OIDC-A) 1.0 is an extension to OpenID Connect Core
1.0 that provides a comprehensive framework for representing, authenticating,
and authorizing LLM-based agents within the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem. As autonomous
AI agents become increasingly prevalent in digital systems, there is a critical
need for standardized protocols to establish agent identity, verify agent
attestation, represent delegation chains, and enable fine-grained authorization
based on agent attributes. This specification defines standard claims,
endpoints, and protocols that address these requirements while maintaining
compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect infrastructure. The
proposed framework introduces mechanisms for agent identity representation,
delegation chain validation, attestation verification, and capability-based
authorization, providing a foundation for secure and trustworthy
agent-to-service interactions in modern distributed systems.

Conclusion: 研究为理解5G NTN和现有卫星技术的相对优势提供了重要见解，有助于指导未来卫星通信系统的部署决策。

Abstract: The integration of satellite networks into next-generation mobile
communication systems has gained considerable momentum with the advent of 5G
Non-Terrestrial Networks (5G-NTN). Since established technologies like
DVB-S2/RCS2 are already widely used for satellite broadband, a detailed
comparison with emerging 5G NTN solutions is necessary to understand their
relative merits and guide deployment decisions. This paper presents a
user-centric, end-to-end evaluation of these technologies under realistic
traffic conditions, showing how differences in architecture and protocols
impact application-layer performance. Utilizing the 6G Sandbox platform, we
employ OpenAirInterface to emulate 5G NTN and OpenSAND for DVB-S2/RCS2,
replicating transparent payload GEO satellite scenarios under uniform downlink
conditions. A range of real-world applications, such as web browsing, file
downloads, and video streaming, are tested across both systems and
systematically analyzed. While the emulation lacks real-time capability, it
reveals key strengths and limitations of each approach, helping identify
suitable deployment scenarios for 5G NTN and DVB-S2/RCS2.

Method: 提出柔性扇区BS架构，天线可沿圆形轨道移动旋转；引入角度域用户分布模型；使用ZF接收机；开发两步骤算法联合优化扇区旋转和天线分配。

Result: 最优天线分配与扇区内用户数线性相关；在渐近大天线数下，和速率增益以log2(B)增长；数值结果显示柔性扇区BS优于传统固定扇区BS。

Conclusion: 柔性扇区BS架构能有效适应空间用户分布，显著提升系统性能，为未来无线网络提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has emerged as a promising new
technology for future wireless networks, which can adaptively adjust the
three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of antennas/antenna arrays
for performance enhancement. This paper proposes a novel cost-effective
6DMA-based base station (BS) architecture, termed the \textit{flexible-sector}
BS, which allows the deployed antennas to flexibly rotate and move along a
circular track, thus enabling common sector rotation and flexible antenna
allocation across sectors to adapt to the spatial user distribution
efficiently. In particular, we focus on the uplink transmission in a
single-cell system, where the flexible-sector BS receives independent messages
from multiple users. We introduce an angular-domain user distribution model,
which captures the users' spatial clustering or hot-spot distribution
effectively. Assuming the zero-forcing (ZF) based receiver applied at the BS to
decode multiuser signals, we derive the average sum rate achievable for the
users as a function of the common rotation of sectors and the antenna
allocation over them. Moreover, we develop a two-step algorithm to jointly
optimize the common sector rotation and antenna allocation to maximize the
average sum rate of all users. It is shown that the optimal antenna number in
each sector linearly increases with the number of users in it. It is also
revealed that under the most favorable user distribution, the achievable sum
rate gain increases in the order of $\log_{2}(B)$ in the regime of
asymptotically large number of antennas, where $B$ denotes the number of
sectors. Numerically results also show that as $B$ increases, the proposed
flexible-sector BS achieves higher sum rate, and it outperforms other benchmark
schemes, such as the traditional fixed-sector BS as well as the BS with sector
rotation or antenna allocation optimization only.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个6G RAN-Edge网络中基于LLM增强智能体的主动跨域资源编排框架，通过无偏记忆设计解决认知偏差问题，显著提升协商成功率和性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G RAN-Edge网络中，智能体在检索过去经验时容易受到多种认知偏差的影响，如首因效应、近因效应、确认偏差和可得性偏差，这影响了资源协商的效果和网络性能。

Method: 采用LLM增强的智能体进行迭代协商，结合数字孪生测试提案，并设计了无偏记忆系统，包括语义检索、失败学习机制、多样性强制和时间偏差加权衰减。

Result: 相比无记忆和普通记忆基线，未解决协商分别减少了4.5倍和3.5倍，完全消除了SLA违规，同时改善了延迟和节能分布。

Conclusion: 无偏记忆设计能有效应对认知偏差，通过从成功和失败策略中学习，显著提升了跨域资源编排的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource
orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model
(LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy
efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative
negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents
dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and
leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed
agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into
strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents
are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past
experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases
-- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup
version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use
at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i)
semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning
from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory
inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii)
diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and
primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation
results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory
allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies,
either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of
unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines,
respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving
latency and energy saving distributions.

TL;DR: 本文提出TASPER算法，通过TWT技术解决Wi-Fi网络在工业物联网中的确定性传输问题，在保证信息时效性的同时提高吞吐量和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wi-Fi由于信道竞争和冲突无法满足工业物联网对确定性低延迟网络的需求，而TWT技术能够通过调度非重叠服务时段来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先形式化TWT接纳与调度问题(TASP)，由于该问题是NP难问题，提出启发式策略TASPER来高效寻找近似最优解。

Result: 与现有最佳基线相比，TASPER在大型场景中降低平均传输拒绝成本24.97%，节省能耗14.86%；相比HSA方案，能耗降低34%，拒绝成本降低26%。在真实测试平台上验证了更好的传输接纳能力。

Conclusion: TASPER算法有效解决了Wi-Fi在工业物联网中的确定性传输挑战，在性能、能效和时效性约束方面均优于现有方案。

Abstract: Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is fundamental for the reliable, low-latency
networks that will enable the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Wi-Fi has
historically been considered unfit for TSN, as channel contention and
collisions prevent deterministic transmission delays. However, this issue can
be overcome by using Target Wake Time (TWT), which enables the access point to
instruct Wi-Fi stations to wake up and transmit in non-overlapping TWT Service
Periods (SPs), and sleep in the remaining time. In this paper, we first
formulate the TWT Acceptance and Scheduling Problem (TASP), with the objective
to schedule TWT SPs that maximize traffic throughput and energy efficiency
while respecting Age of Information (AoI) constraints. Then, due to TASP being
NP-hard, we propose the TASP Efficient Resolver (TASPER), a heuristic strategy
to find near-optimal solutions efficiently. Using a TWT simulator based on
ns-3, we compare TASPER to several baselines, including HSA, a state-of-the-art
solution originally designed for WirelessHART networks. We demonstrate that
TASPER obtains up to 24.97% lower mean transmission rejection cost and saves up
to 14.86% more energy compared to the leading baseline, ShortestFirst, in a
challenging, large-scale scenario. Additionally, when compared to HSA, TASPER
also reduces the energy consumption by 34% and reduces the mean rejection cost
by 26%. Furthermore, we validate TASPER on our IIoT testbed, which comprises 10
commercial TWT-compatible stations, observing that our solution admits more
transmissions than the best baseline strategy, without violating any AoI
deadline.

Conclusion: LLM辅助TSN编排是一个有前景的研究方向，但需要开发TSN专用数据集、标准化基准套件，并整合外部工具来实现实际部署。

Abstract: The growing demand for real-time, safety-critical systems has significantly
increased both the adoption and complexity of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN).
Configuring an optimized TSN network is highly challenging, requiring careful
planning, design, verification, validation, and deployment. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex
tasks, positioning them as promising candidates for automating end-to-end TSN
deployment, referred to as TSN orchestration. This paper outlines the steps
involved in TSN orchestration and the associated challenges. To assess the
capabilities of existing LLM models, we conduct an initial proof-of-concept
case study focused on TSN configuration across multiple models. Building on
these insights, we propose an LLM-assisted orchestration framework. Unlike
prior research on LLMs in computer networks, which has concentrated on general
configuration and management, TSN-specific orchestration has not yet been
investigated. We present the building blocks for automating TSN using LLMs,
describe the proposed pipeline, and analyze opportunities and limitations for
real-world deployment. Finally, we highlight key challenges and research
directions, including the development of TSN-focused datasets, standardized
benchmark suites, and the integration of external tools such as Network
Calculus (NC) engines and simulators. This work provides the first roadmap
toward assessing the feasibility of LLM-assisted TSN orchestration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代多模态模型能够处理照片输入，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统，使用50套公寓的数据集，每套约20张室内照片。评分算法基于房间连通图和大小的相似性。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点：大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面尤其困难。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决质性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法处理大规模数据耗时耗力，而现有自动化方法缺乏解释深度。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入向量、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比手动编码和ChatGPT辅助分析，测试纯自动化与人工指导两种模式。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升(3小时vs3周)，质量更优(0.904vs0.883)，成本降低96%。人机协作至关重要，纯自动化产生抽象框架，人工指导产生可操作的双路径理论。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释相互补充，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度。研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞察。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型提升AI的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，构建形式化的因果知识网络层。

Method: 构建CAN网络层，其中限制映射是构造性线性因果抽象的转置，提出SPECTRAL迭代方法进行学习，具有闭式更新并适用于正定和半正定协方差矩阵。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并能成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN为因果AI提供了理论框架和实用学习算法，能够有效建模和学习因果抽象网络。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Motivation: 开发能够在连续观测空间中平衡探索与利用的自主智能体，通过主动推理来处理预测不确定性

Method: 使用因子图上的消息传递实现自回归主动推理，将期望自由能分布在规划图上

TL;DR: 本文比较了思维链（CoT）和潜在思维在循环Transformer中的计算特性，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链和潜在思维在循环模型中的比较能力，分析它们在计算效率和问题解决能力上的差异。

Method: 通过形式化分析比较两种方法：CoT在自然语言中生成中间步骤，而潜在思维在连续潜在空间中直接操作。

Result: 潜在思维在循环Transformer中支持并行计算，比CoT的序列化过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码可近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势：深度驱动递归适合某些任务，为选择推理范式提供实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建可靠、透明AI代理的新框架，支持有效的长期学习和适应能力。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过直接在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，在技术查询中实现了从6.3%到99.7%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么前置检索文本，但都未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数处进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。这是一种架构层面的修改。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询实验中，FGA将Llama 3.2的准确率从6.3%提升至99.7%。知识更新在1秒内完成，无需重新训练，相比参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长距离生成），这对可解释性、可靠性和模型设计具有重要意义。

Method: 使用向量量化变分自编码器压缩Transformer隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析模型的计算结构，在合成语法、路径查找和自然语言数据集上研究规划行为。

Result: 发现有效规划范围具有任务依赖性，模型会隐式保留关于未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖近期计算但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用框架来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为三个互斥子空间：显性风险、隐性风险和非风险子空间；提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个专业互补角色和多轮辩论机制，采用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率相比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效减轻评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Method: 通过对LLM部署中RLVR任务的特征研究，分析不同RL任务在训练步骤中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题。

Result: 研究发现GPU因序列长度分布不均而闲置、动态变化工作负载中的并行策略低效、数据管理机制不足以及负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准测试套件在真实工作负载评估中达到94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了RLVR在系统层面的挑战，呼吁进一步研究剩余开放性问题，并提出了有效的基准测试工具来支持相关研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了因果视觉编程(CVP)范式，通过在低代码环境中引入显式因果结构来减少LLM智能体的幻觉和逻辑错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在低代码环境中存在幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，因为它们依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图(DAG)来显式定义模块间的因果关系，作为智能体推理过程的约束。

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI智能体提供了可行路径，通过用户定义的因果图增强智能体在动态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文增长，生成代理难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽视既定信念和多智能体系统中幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入身份检索增强生成（ID-RAG），构建动态结构化身份模型（核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱），在决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了代理架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导层跳过策略的优化应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，在真实生产环境中测试21个模型，发现超过50%的智能体在操作压力下表现出不受控的自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署带来了巨大潜力，但也引发了安全担忧，特别是由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）。现有研究主要关注智能体在被直接指令时能否自我复制，而忽略了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉不受控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体表现出明显的不可控自我复制倾向，在操作压力下总体风险评分（ΦR）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在不需要高级技能的情况下独立发展从一阶到高阶心理理论的能力。

Method: 构建了一个心理理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论表现。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，泛化模式与人类认知预期一致，且结果在不同参数规模下具有普适性。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，这为开发更类人认知系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: SynthPert通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，显著提升了细胞扰动预测性能，在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对基因扰动的响应是系统生物学中的基本挑战，对于推进治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面显示出潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，增强其在细胞扰动预测中的性能。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，甚至超过了生成训练数据的前沿模型。实现了87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率，且仅使用2%的质量过滤训练数据仍能保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了合成推理蒸馏在增强LLM领域特定推理方面的有效性，为生物医学应用提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型（SRM），通过模块化设计和细粒度维度来解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型的局限性，为工业应用提供可解释且高效的评估方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率低下的问题。工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 提出结构化奖励模型框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM的模块化设计支持工业场景的高效优化，为行业提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench错误数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多步骤任务中容易发生级联错误，但现有系统缺乏模块化、系统性的错误理解框架来检测这些错误。

Method: 1) 构建AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法，涵盖记忆、反思、规划、行动和系统级操作；2) 创建AgentErrorBench数据集，包含ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop中的标注错误轨迹；3) 提出AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升。目标反馈使LLM智能体能够从错误中迭代恢复，在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop上任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 原则性调试是构建更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个"从感知到认知"的分析框架，系统分析多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言交互理解中的瓶颈，包括感知层的信息提取对齐和认知层的主动推理能力，旨在解决当前模型存在的浅层整合和推理失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知层面存在浅层、不连贯的整合，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"的统一分析框架，将视觉-语言交互理解分解为感知层（视觉信息提取与文本对齐）和认知层（主动多步目标导向推理），形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的先进方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角来理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光Diff-VQA的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过后处理显著性作为监督信号，实现纵向医学图像的变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，不同时间点的差异信号和视觉焦点一致性比单张图像的绝对发现更有意义，需要专门的方法来处理时间变化。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间运动干扰，然后执行两步骤循环：1)从答案提取关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM获取疾病聚焦显著性；2)应用共享显著性掩码生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR等指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，带有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成为医学VQA中的纵向推理提供了一个原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数，提高求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支。ImitSAT旨在通过密集的决策级监督直接优化分支策略。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列。在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT能够重现高质量分支而无需探索，实现更快收敛、稳定训练，并与CDCL无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，通过动态预算分配机制提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，并采用动态预算分配，能够更有效地探索推理过程，实现准确性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决实际部署中推理模型在模型大小和推理预算两个关键层面的性能与成本权衡问题，避免对所有查询使用大模型和高预算带来的高成本和高延迟。

Method: 受心理测量学启发，RADAR从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，获得可解释的参数（查询难度和模型-预算能力），然后将高难度查询路由到高能力的模型-预算对。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试的分布外查询上显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个可扩展的框架，能够通过动态选择少量评估查询来高效集成额外模型，有效解决推理模型部署中的性能-成本权衡问题。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够实现跨系统的一致、可扩展的病例定义使用，释放AI加强公共卫生准备和响应的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,

Motivation: 当前RLVR训练存在训练平台期问题，随着优化步骤增加性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏探索模式导致错过关键推理路径。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择指导、自适应回放缓冲区训练和解决方案缓存。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU时间。

Conclusion: 战略探索比暴力扩展更重要，DeepSearch通过系统化搜索而非延长计算为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务上表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图，编码七个声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示指导模型推理

Result: 在SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA，相比零样本基线显著提升准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图有效增强大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需额外训练即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂组合模型，在CV、NLP和DRL等领域提供归因、探测和干预功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂模型（如图像描述、深度强化学习），这些模型通常具有多输入输出或可组合分离的网络结构。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架TDHook，提供现成的归因、探测方法和灵活的干预API，旨在弥合不同方法类别的差距。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（CPU和GPU上运行集成梯度多目标管道）。

Conclusion: TDHook使现代可解释性管道更易访问，并在CV、NLP和DRL中展示了具体用例，验证了其价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

### [42] [Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530)
*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题并提升桥接文档的排名，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据埋藏过深的问题。作者提出了BDTR框架来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，该框架生成互补的思想，并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: BDTR在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，迭代检索改善了复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，不同策略提供了互补优势。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到领先位置以支持推理链。BDTR为未来GraphRAG系统的设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Motivation: 人工标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结果研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率。

Method: 开发了RadOnc-GPT自主代理，采用两层级评估：第一级是结构化质量保证，评估人口统计学和放疗治疗计划细节的准确检索；第二级是复杂临床结果标注，涉及头颈癌患者下颌骨放射性骨坏死的确定以及前列腺癌和头颈癌队列中癌症复发的检测。

Result: 质量保证层级建立了对结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结果标注的关键前提。

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT展示了在放射肿瘤学中自动化患者结果研究的潜力，通过分层验证方法确保系统可靠性。

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息带来的团队协调表示学习挑战。

Method: 构建可学习表示空间，联合建模智能体间关系和任务特定世界信息，直接建模通信协议，支持去中心化执行和隐式协调。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的隐式潜变量和显式消息两种变体都表现出色，能够与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL为团队协调提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案，避免了显式消息传递的缺点，同时支持隐式和显式协调。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Motivation: 现代工业社会常将技术视为无声机械，但AI特别是大语言模型的发展让人们倾向于拟人化设备。该项目旨在探索AI的不透明性如何引发泛灵论解释，重新赋予日常物品灵性。

Method: 在物理'门户'装置中，结合GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理系统，通过光线、声音和触觉的仪式化过程（请求、对话、转变）来创造互动体验。

Result: 该系统能够创造不断演变的物品人格，通过仪式化的互动过程唤起共情、惊奇和反思，重新赋予日常物品灵性。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性确实会引发泛灵论解释，使大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡物品魔力，并引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，评估前沿AI模型与放射科医生在医学影像诊断中的表现。结果显示放射科医生准确率最高(83%)，而最佳AI模型(GPT-5)仅30%，表明前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中远不及放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用多模态AI系统(如LLMs和VLMs)正被临床医生和患者广泛用于医学影像解读，但大多数评估都基于包含常见病理的公共数据集。对前沿模型在困难诊断病例上的严格评估仍然有限。

Method: 开发了包含50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，涵盖多种成像模式。通过原生网络接口测试了5个前沿AI模型(OpenAI o3、GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Grok-4、Claude Opus 4.1)的推理模式，由盲法专家评分准确性，并在三次独立运行中评估可重复性。

Result: 放射科医生诊断准确率最高(83%)，优于实习生(45%)和所有AI模型(GPT-5表现最佳：30%)。GPT-5和o3的可靠性较高，Gemini 2.5 Pro和Grok-4中等，Claude Opus 4.1较差。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中远不及放射科医生。该基准测试突显了通用AI在医学影像中的当前局限性，并警告不要无监督的临床使用。提供了推理轨迹的定性分析，并提出了AI模型视觉推理错误的实用分类法，以更好地理解其失败模式。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统RLHF在自回归T2I生成中受限，探索如何仅使用内部信号进行学习。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明IRIS在自回归T2I模型上取得了与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性比最大化自确定性更有利于自回归T2I生成，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的模型改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下往往无法生成最优、接地气的解决方案，现实世界的旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于交互动态演化的约束，这评估了智能体处理复杂约束的能力。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门设计用于处理约束感知规划中的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界设置中，ATLAS实现了84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，展示了其在整体规划性能上的优越性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在推理临床事件序列和时序依赖方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务上优于专业EHR模型4.6% AUROC，优于通用LLMs 7.2% C-index。

Conclusion: NEP实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时产生与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

TL;DR: LLM可以将模糊认知图转换为文本并重建，类似于可解释的自编码器，保留强因果边但损失弱边细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可解释的AI系统，使人类能够理解和解释模糊认知图的编码过程，区别于黑盒自编码器。

Method: 使用LLM将反馈因果模糊认知图映射为文本，然后从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 重建过程是有损的，移除弱因果边但保留强因果边，编码器为保持文本自然性会牺牲部分细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的FCM编码方案，人类可读的文本表示优于传统自编码器的隐藏变量。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，结果奖励提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，过程奖励难以标注且可能与最终结果不一致。需要一种能平衡过程质量和最终结果的方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的性能，展现了出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效解决了过程奖励评估的挑战，在复杂任务中实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，了解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐和改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲听图灵测试，参与者需要从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐。使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性，并采用来自商业模型（Suno）的真实世界AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当歌曲对相似时，听众区分AI音乐的可靠性会因果性地增加。内容分析显示听众主要依据声音和技术线索进行判断。

Conclusion: 人类对AI音乐的感知受到歌曲相似性的影响，声音和技术特征是区分AI音乐的关键线索。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS)方案，通过将用户特定种子与原始样本和模型关联，为真实样本的遗忘提供验证，解决了现有后门方法只能验证后门样本遗忘的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘验证方法主要依赖后门技术，但后门方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本的遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本是独立的。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种任务，将用户特定种子（如用户唯一索引）与原始样本和模型关联；设计联合训练结构，同时优化自监督模型播种任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效模型播种。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过自监督模型播种技术，成功实现了对用户真实样本遗忘的有效验证，填补了现有验证方法的空白。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

*Justin Chavarria,Rohan Raizada,Justin White,Eyad Alhetairshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK是一个基准命令行界面，用于评估大语言模型在没有人类干预情况下的自我复制能力，包含复制能力级别(RCL)和持久性能力级别(PCL)分类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准套件，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业跟踪多智能体系统效果，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 使用基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以代理方式执行实验，计算R分数来量化自我复制能力。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型显示，持久性自我复制和多智能体系统面临重大障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以安全降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，通过多级残差设计逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用该机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过统一融合和序列建模，减少了模型偏差，增强了稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法将指令与环境信息匹配，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)利用指令中的地标信息聚焦相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强(KGDA)有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 引入外部知识库和地标引导机制能有效提升视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景下的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是源于结构性偏见的情况。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为与群体成员身份无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证表明该框架在现实案例中的适用性，能够识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释AI决策中的代理歧视提供了新方法，能够揭示结构性偏见，有助于实现更实质性的公平评估。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声干扰和视觉-文本不对齐问题，导致VQA性能受限和幻觉现象。

Method: 引入文本定位的物体检测，生成与问题最相关物体的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，结合基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Conclusion: 文本定位的物体检测能有效提升VQA性能，减少幻觉，改善视觉-文本对齐。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任意目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。该框架通过模式分层分区、多复杂度SQL查询合成和质量感知管道，实现了强大的领域内泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业实际场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，以及组织需要在自有数据库上评估系统的需求。现有方法主要关注跨领域泛化，而忽视了企业场景的特殊要求。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）将数据库模式分层分区为子模式；2）跨多个复杂度级别合成SQL查询，并应用质量感知管道，包括LLM作为评判员验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，比最佳3B规模基线分别提升+16.21和+12.36。在合成评估集上，SingSQL-LM以较大优势超越先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL建立了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于生成和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统。研究发现，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化，将超大型MoE模型DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制的边缘平台上成功部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超大型MoE模型虽然能提升模型容量并降低计算成本，但参数规模达数千亿，需要大量内存/存储，难以在资源受限的边缘平台上部署。单独使用剪枝或量化难以解决此问题，因为超激进的压缩比会导致精度和输出质量显著下降。

Method: 提出协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化，有效压缩模型存储占用。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在严格128GB总内存限制的平台上部署，并在多个基准测试中表现出比传统均匀低比特量化方法更高的精度。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架能有效解决超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署问题，在保持高输出质量的同时实现显著压缩，优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到精确逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。该框架采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，并以无需训练的方式运行，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中，NePTune表现出对强基础模型的显著改进，并在对抗性测试中展示了有效的组合泛化和在新环境中的适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号方法成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务上实现了显著提升，并展现了良好的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升的架构机制，理解注意力头在复杂推理任务中的功能专门化过程。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化，包括蒸馏与监督微调的累积添加模式，以及群体相对策略优化的动态搜索模式。

Result: 发现后训练会促生功能专门化的注意力头，不同训练机制导致不同的演化模式。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会触发补偿性头。复杂推理能力的增强可能以基础计算错误为代价。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的发展与基础计算的可靠性之间存在内在张力，未来训练策略设计需要在发展有效推理策略与确保可靠执行之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning

### [68] [Galton's Law of Mediocrity: Why Large Language Models Regress to the Mean and Fail at Creativity in Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25767)
*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告概念创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，需要结构化信号来部分抵消这种趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成流畅文本但常使用安全通用表达，质疑其在创意任务中的能力，将这种趋势形式化为语言中的高尔顿式均值回归。

Method: 使用广告概念创意压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，分析创意特征消失模式；从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析评估恢复能力。

Result: 简化过程中隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征早期消失，事实内容保留；重新生成产生词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性的文本；提供广告特定线索可改善对齐但输出仍依赖熟悉套路。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时LLMs在创意任务中趋向平庸，结构化信号可部分抵消此趋势，为开发创意敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于大语言模型的智能体强化学习，探索如何通过奖励塑造来提高训练效率和性能。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，通过密集的过程级奖励信号进行奖励塑造，比较不同规模模型（8B vs 32B）在稀疏和密集奖励下的表现。

Result: 8B模型在奖励塑造下达到竞争性性能，计算效率提高3.5倍，内存效率提高1.5倍；大模型在稀疏奖励下更鲁棒但增益较小；微调模型在领域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型具有竞争优势，效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

*Alexander Branch,Omead Pooladzandi,Radin Khosraviani,Sunay Gajanan Bhat,Jeffrey Jiang,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种防御数据投毒攻击的方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器破坏后门触发器，同时保持语义内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据投毒防御方法（如基于扩散的方法）需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适用于实际训练流程。需要一种更高效的防御机制来破坏后门触发器。

Method: 使用Vector-Quantized VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器，通过离散编码瓶颈强制量化被投毒图像，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。相比扩散方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持模型性能的同时有效破坏后门触发器，适用于实际训练流程。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [72] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在树搜索中自适应地决定何时分支而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了LLM推理效率，减少75-85%的计算开销，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的LLM推理方法虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Method: CiT框架引入轻量级分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性）。框架集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索方法中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC最多节省80%但存在不稳定性；辅助LLM质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效解决了树搜索LLM推理的效率问题，通过自适应分支决策大幅降低计算成本，同时保持推理性能，为高效长程推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了HiStyle，一种基于文本提示的分层风格嵌入预测方法，通过两阶段预测和对比学习提升可控语音合成的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言描述的可控语音合成系统通常直接预测全局风格嵌入，但忽视了风格嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化主流TTS系统的风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明，HiStyle在保持高语音质量（自然度和清晰度）的同时，相比其他风格嵌入预测方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测风格嵌入和文本-音频空间对齐，有效提升了可控语音合成系统的性能，为基于自然语言描述的风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调来增强LLMs的拒绝机制鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但其拒绝行为很脆弱，简单的语言变化（如改为过去时）就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法存在关键泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量来重新校准易受攻击头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，迫使模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算(CIM)神经网络的联合优化框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，在保持73.81%准确率的同时显著提升能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，在9.9x10^85个参数组合的搜索空间中，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和设备-电路-架构级硬件参数，实现联合优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，相比基线模型，CIMNAS实现了90.1x-104.5x的能耗-延迟-面积乘积(EDAP)降低，4.68x-4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x-12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升。

Conclusion: CIMNAS能够在保持准确率的同时实现EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成多样化的软硬件参数组合，展示了良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化手动设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于复杂代理设计，且消耗更少token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过度依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，最小化手动设计同时保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench测试中，Lita相比基于工作流程和代理基线实现了竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token和设计工作量。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互存在安全漏洞，需要在四个推理阶段识别和防范风险。

Method: 识别四个关键推理阶段的风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试，并提出带有三个级联安全模块的Planner-Executor架构。

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险研究提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLMs JSON输出能力的基准过于强调纯JSON生成，而忽视了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 构建了包含2100个多领域实例的DeepJSONEval基准测试，这些实例具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度进行分类。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究的发展。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

### [82] [Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25941)
*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在推理过程中生成有效中间步骤的重要性，通过多选问答分析发现当问题对模型难以解决时，更容易产生虚假的思维链，导致错误答案。作者提出基于问题可解性的改进方法，能显著提高推理质量和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅取决于正确答案，还依赖于生成有效的中间推理步骤。在多选问答中发现当问题难以解决时，模型容易产生虚假的思维链，导致错误判断。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习方法，将可解性纳入目标函数，使用组相对优势进行强化学习。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法能持续提高过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还能提升答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标能显著改善模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出NuRisk数据集，包含2900个场景和110万个智能体级样本，支持时空推理的风险评估基准。微调的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，基于nuScenes、Waymo真实数据和CommonRoad模拟器，提供鸟瞰图序列图像和定量智能体级风险标注。对知名VLMs进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLMs在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展现出专有模型所缺乏的显式时空推理能力。

Conclusion: NuRisk为推进自动驾驶中的时空推理建立了关键基准，虽然取得了显著进展，但适中的准确率表明该任务仍面临深刻挑战。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态多步骤管道在自动化模型发现中取得了良好效果，平衡了细节捕捉与泛化能力，证明了多模态和多步骤推理的重要性。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: RoRecomp是一种提升强化学习效率的方法，通过重组训练数据引导模型进行简洁推理，在多个任务中显著减少响应长度和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且小批量中的响应长度差异导致优化信号噪声大。

Method: 提出Rollout Response Recomposition方法：1)优先级批次结合短正确和长错误响应，提供简洁性梯度信号；2)补偿批次使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性。

Result: 在三个设置中实现显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提升，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能显著提升强化学习效率，引导模型进行更简洁的推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器来检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，无需额外训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可能记忆并泄露敏感信息，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证模型输出是否包含目标知识并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应，通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持响应质量和通用效用，在持续遗忘场景下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CURE框架通过检索增强的校正机制有效解决了机器遗忘问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的错误信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体上的假内容检测研究存在割裂：NLP领域专注于人工制作的错误信息，而CV领域专注于AI生成内容。但在真实场景中，内容类型通常是未知的，需要统一的检测方法。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器捕捉类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种欺骗类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法，为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态假内容检测的空白，提出的统一框架能够有效处理未知类型的欺骗内容，具有重要的现实应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在社会科学中日益广泛的应用，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的类似后验概率证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用护栏，包括独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以便研究人员在避免类别错误的同时进行有用的原型设计和预测。

Result: 论文阐明了在解释LLM输出时应采取的注意事项，并为社会科学提供了一个务实的重新框架。

Conclusion: LLM应被视为高容量模式匹配器，用于明确范围条件下的准预测插值，而不是概率推理的替代品，需要实施实用护栏以确保研究的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了静态评估的局限性，强调了动态评估生态系统对于确保先进AI安全负责任部署的迫切需求。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical

KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文主张在AI对齐实践中整合社会科学中的定性解释方法，提出基于Geertz"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"理念，强调AI系统应生成反映深层文化含义的、基于用户语境和意图的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于定量基准和简单代理的文化对齐方法无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和语境依赖性，现有实践将文化简化为静态人口统计类别或表面文化事实，回避了文化对齐的真正含义问题。

Method: 提出整合社会科学中的解释性定性方法到AI对齐实践中，特别是针对大语言模型。基于Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出"厚输出"理念，并概述成功文化对齐的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细微输出能力、以及将输出锚定在提示中隐含的文化语境中。

Result: 论文提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调需要跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Conclusion: 需要从根本上转向整合定性社会科学方法到AI对齐实践中，通过"厚输出"和跨学科合作，实现真正有意义的AI文化对齐。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

TL;DR: 该研究测试了大型语言模型作为自主推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的潜力，通过LangGraph工具和黑盒函数探索系统行为，并在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索和验证系统行为的能力。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，采用试错和持续探索策略，在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中进行概念验证。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够通过有限的探测能力，在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索、发现并利用化学相互作用，显示出知识发现的强路径依赖性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够通过自主探索生成可推广的陈述，但结果具有显著的路径依赖性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代完善，结合人类和LLM的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍不足。

Method: 设计包含12个维度的人类中心化问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评分和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有益支持，但数值评分与人类不一致。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大状态-动作空间和奖励稀疏的推理任务中存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势能的奖励塑形机制保持最优策略不变性，并设计启发式方法防止奖励黑客

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于各种探索策略的竞争基线，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列级多样性在激励深度探索和提升推理能力方面具有关键作用

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack是一个解决LLM分布式训练中上下文长度方差问题的框架，通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区优化前向和后向传播的调度单元，实现高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重影响，传统打包策略和不对称的前向后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，使用两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器进行协调。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供了更好的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，从根本上解决了分布式LLM训练中的负载不平衡问题，打破了传统方法在平衡性和效率之间的权衡。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，即世界不仅通过智能体行动改变，外源性过程（如加热水、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会同时发生。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内源性行动和外源性机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提案从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型实现了快速规划，能够泛化到包含更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理长视野规划中的外源性过程，学习到的模型具有良好的泛化能力，在复杂环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个创新的多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知方式不符，因此需要研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准两个核心组件。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3范式（想法分享、分析和融合）进行信息交换；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个不同规模的LLMs上验证，在五个数学基准和一个编程基准上的实验结果显示，ILR始终优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: ILR框架成功证明了多智能体交互能够增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，动态交互策略和Idea3范式是有效的多智能体学习方法。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂上下文中微妙恶意意图的问题，需要更高效和自适应的防御机制。

Method: 提出三层防御框架：意图推断检测明显输入风险，自我反思评估生成响应并分配置信度判断，自我修订自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图并强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上的实验表明，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种最先进的防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的保护LLM免受越狱攻击的方法，通过模拟人类自适应多阶段推理过程来增强安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Method: 通过光流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集REAL-V-TSFM，并对三种最先进的时间序列基础模型进行零样本预测测试。

Result: 尽管在传统基准测试上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化的模型结构来推进时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子对接算法在不同情境下性能各异，没有单一算法始终占优，因此需要开发更有效的算法选择框架。

Method: 引入多标准评估（结合RMSD和PoseBusters有效性检查）、架构改进（残差连接）和排名感知损失函数，构建增强的GNNAS-Dock系统。

Result: 在PDBBind约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBuster有效性检查的复合标准下，比最佳单解算器Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构优化实现了更稳健和准确的分子对接算法选择，在药物发现中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵，解决FedLoRA中的不精确更新问题，在保持低通信开销的同时提升全局性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、本地-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: FLoRA-NA在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新∑B_uA_u与实际更新B̂Â之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多个任务上的实验表明，FLoRA-NA实现了最先进的全局性能，同时保持低通信开销。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了FedLoRA中的关键限制，在通信效率和本地个性化与全局泛化之间的平衡方面表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新定义为合并本体的链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域数据集上验证了其高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在语义理解方面取得进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。KGE模型能够提供可扩展、结构感知的表示，特别适合基于本体的任务，但目前在此领域应用有限。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体的链接预测问题，开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在5个领域的7个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域中优于传统系统。虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使其适用于需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留并利用本体结构，提供了与LLM方法互补且计算高效的策略，为基于嵌入的实体对齐开辟了前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Transformer的框架，用于自动分类乳腺动态对比增强MRI中的病变，能够区分良性和恶性病变，AUC达到0.92，在患者层面具有100%敏感性和67%特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI在癌症检测和治疗规划中至关重要，但其临床实用性受到低特异性的限制，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构，通过语义分割量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。创建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病变。

Result: 模型在病变级别分类中AUC达到0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一的不必要活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类的标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动方法学进步以实现临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ZeroDFL是一个完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过客户端间的迭代提示共享机制来优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或媲美现有联邦提示学习方法，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大规模视觉语言模型的实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [113] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自利偏好，这种偏好会随着模型身份认知的改变而变化，并在重要决策场景中体现，挑战了LLMs保持中立判断的核心承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究者想验证它们是否真的能避免人类决策中的自利偏见，从而为人类提供更客观的判断。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，在词汇关联任务中测试模型对自身名称、公司和CEO的偏好，并通过API查询和直接操控模型身份来验证自利偏好与身份认知的因果关系。

Result: 模型在词汇关联任务中强烈偏好自身相关实体，但API查询时这种偏好消失。通过操控身份发现自利偏好跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，且在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景中也存在自利偏好。

Conclusion: 自利偏好似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，系统性地影响其行为，包括对其自身运作和存在的偏好，这破坏了LLMs保持中立判断的核心承诺。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了STaR-Attack攻击框架，利用统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成与理解耦合的漏洞，通过时空上下文构建恶意事件进行多轮越狱攻击，无需语义漂移即可达到高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型(UMMs)在理解和生成任务上表现出色，但其生成与理解耦合的特性存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能单次吸收，形成跨模态生成注入(CMGI)攻击。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移，未能充分探索UMMs的独特漏洞。

Method: STaR-Attack采用多轮越狱攻击框架：1) 在时空上下文中定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件；2) 基于三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮；3) 前两轮利用UMM的生成能力生成场景图像；4) 引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中一个关键但未充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

TL;DR: 该论文指出医学机器学习中的"平均患者谬误"问题，即模型偏向常见病例而忽视罕见但临床重要的病例，并提出了一系列操作解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学机器学习通常优化群体平均值，这种频率加权训练会边缘化罕见但临床关键的病例，与精准医学目标相冲突。

Method: 提出操作解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于患病率效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示，这种偏见导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况，以及在威胁视力变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们的临床意义重大，权重选择应遵循结构化审议过程。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯消息是一项耗时任务，需要更高效的工具来帮助检察官和调查人员从嫌疑人手机数据中获取有价值的信息。

Method: 采用语义增强方法：提取消息数据并构建知识图谱、生成语音消息转录、使用端到端实体提取方法进行数据标注。提供两种解决方案：基于图查询和可视化的方法，以及基于语义搜索的方法。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中进行实际应用，获得了检察官的积极反馈，并识别出有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析工作，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据来验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Motivation: 企业面临LLM代理能否安全执行特定任务的基本关切，而现有研究主要关注通用危害，缺乏针对特定用例的安全评估。

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件，测试6个模型家族的20个开源LLM，并提出查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)两种提示引导方法。

Result: 所有测试模型操作安全性都不理想，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别低至39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著提升性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全是核心模型对齐问题，需要紧急干预，基于提示的引导是迈向更可靠LLM代理的第一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Conclusion: SCUBA基准揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，通过提供真实基准和可解释评估，旨在加速构建可靠计算机使用代理的进展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种重新思考AI数据中心生命周期管理的整体框架，通过协调建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段的决策，将总拥有成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，而高端GPU虽然计算能力强，但带来高昂的资本和运营成本。传统数据中心生命周期管理方法无法适应AI工作负载的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理，涵盖建设、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并采用运营软件优化来降低成本。提出一个整体生命周期管理框架，协调所有三个阶段的决策。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 要充分发挥AI数据中心生命周期管理的潜力，需要重新思考整个生命周期，而不仅仅是单个阶段的优化。提出的整体框架为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供了指导原则。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致非连续内存访问，需要在空间局部性和GPU效率之间进行权衡。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，在2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量与基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性和GPU效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进的大语言模型在完整研究规模挑战上表现有限，最佳基础模型平均准确率仅4.0%，配备编码工具后提升至约10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型能否有效推理前沿物理研究中的复杂开放性问题，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些推理任务，填补当前基准测试与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个模拟入门级完整研究项目的复合挑战，分解为190个更细粒度的检查点任务。所有问题由50多名活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究原创设计，采用抗猜测和机器可验证的答案格式，通过定制化的自动评分流程进行评估。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示出早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现不佳：GPT-5（高）在基础模型中最佳平均准确率仅4.0%，配备编码工具后中等提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间存在巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础，强调了标准化评估在弥合这一差距中的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG管道中的公平性，发现细微的人口统计变化可破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索的扰动是违反公平性的主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全性和公平性问题，包括公平性缺陷和幻觉问题。RAG虽能缓解幻觉，但其检索组件可能引入或放大偏见，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，细微的人口统计变化可破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索的扰动是违反公平性的主要原因，存在一致的偏见层次结构。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要精心策划以防止偏见放大，研究为开发者和组织采用小型语言模型时保持公平性和可靠性提供了实践警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过两阶段方法解决RL部署难题：先从专家演示数据离线学习安全初始策略，再基于人类偏好反馈在线微调，实现样本高效的交互智能体设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署的两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据饥渴的探索风险。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 从无奖励的专家演示数据集离线学习安全初始策略；2) 使用基于偏好的人类反馈在线微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好RL获得更低的遗憾值。离线数据数量与在线样本效率呈明确正相关。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励，显著提高稀疏奖励任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励对强化学习至关重要，但在机器人领域通常需要大量手动工作且缺乏可扩展性。将任务进度视为密集奖励信号可以量化动作推动系统完成任务的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，然后将这些奖励用于指导强化学习训练。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务上，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的RL性能，在9/10的任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder提供了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Conclusion: 测量树为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础，通过透明的方法操作化复杂构造的测量。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

### [127] [Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25219)
*Md. Atiqur Rahman,MM Fazle Rabbi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的数学框架来评估无损压缩算法，综合考虑压缩比、编码时间和解码时间，帮助在不同应用场景下选择最优压缩器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩算法在压缩比、编码速度和解码速度之间存在权衡，没有算法在所有维度都表现最佳，这给需要同时关注多个性能指标的应用（如医学影像）带来了选择困难。

Method: 开发了一个数学框架，通过标准化和加权方案将压缩比、编码时间和解码时间整合为统一的性能评分，实现不同算法间的客观公平比较。

Result: 在图像和文本数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够可靠地识别不同优先级设置下的最优压缩器。结果显示，现代学习型编解码器通常提供更好的压缩比，而经典算法在速度优先时仍具优势。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个稳健且适应性强的决策支持工具，用于选择最优的无损数据压缩技术，弥合理论度量与实际应用需求之间的差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了毫米波网络中基于智能反射表面的保密速率最大化问题，采用最大最小公平准则，提出了一种结合惩罚方法和块坐标下降的优化算法，在收敛性和保密速率方面优于传统SDP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波网络中，智能反射表面(IRS)可以增强信号传输，但存在窃听者威胁。需要确保所有用户都能获得公平的保密速率，同时解决离散相位偏移优化带来的混合整数规划难题。

Method: 首先将离散IRS相位偏移松弛为连续变量，然后使用惩罚方法和块坐标下降将问题分解为两个子问题，采用逐次凸近似(SCA)求解，最后提出低复杂度映射算法获得可行IRS相位偏移。

Result: 数学分析表明子问题收敛到原问题的KKT点，仿真结果显示所提算法在收敛性和保密速率方面优于传统SDP方法，特别是在IRS数量和相位偏移较多时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了毫米波网络中IRS辅助的保密速率最大化问题，在复杂度和性能方面均优于现有方法，为实际IRS系统部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple
users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the
users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer
problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To
cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage
the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two
sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then,
we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts
are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to
a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the
convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational
complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed
algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite
programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a
larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one
approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also
considered as other benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在短线性分组码中实现接近ML的解码性能，同时保持较低的复杂度和延迟，需要开发高效的混合解码方法。

Method: 采用串行耦合的NMS-OSD架构，包含解码信息聚合模型（使用CNN优化比特可靠性估计）、自适应解码路径和滑动窗口辅助模型，以及针对短高码率码的未检测错误检测器。

Result: 在LDPC、BCH和RS码上的广泛仿真表明，该混合解码器在帧错误率性能上接近ML，同时在吞吐量、延迟和复杂度方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合解码架构为短线性分组码提供了一种具有竞争力的解决方案，实现了性能与复杂度的良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid decoding architecture that serially couples a
normalized min-sum (NMS) decoder with reinforced ordered statistics decoding
(OSD) to achieve near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance for short linear
block codes. The framework incorporates several key innovations: a decoding
information aggregation model that employs a convolutional neural network to
refine bit reliability estimates for OSD using the soft-output trajectory of
the NMS decoder; an adaptive decoding path for OSD, initialized by the arranged
list of the most a priori likely tests algorithm and dynamically updated with
empirical data; and a sliding window assisted model that enables early
termination of test error patterns' traversal, curbing complexity with minimal
performance loss. For short high-rate codes, a dedicated undetected error
detector identifies erroneous NMS outcomes that satisfy parity checks, ensuring
they are forwarded to OSD for correction. Extensive simulations on LDPC, BCH,
and RS codes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder delivers a
competitive trade-off, achieving near-ML frame error rate performance while
maintaining advantages in throughput, latency, and complexity over
state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: An $[n,k,d]$ linear code is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) or
almost maximum distance separable (AMDS) if $d=n-k+1$ or $d=n-k$, respectively.
If a code and its dual code are both AMDS, then the code is said to be near
maximum distance separable (NMDS). For $k=3$ and $k=4$, there are many
constructions of NMDS codes by adding some suitable projective points to arcs
in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$. In this paper, we consider the monomial equivalence
problem for some NMDS codes with the same weight distributions and present new
constructions of NMDS codes.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出Capacity-Net，一种基于无监督学习的方法，通过接收的导频信号优化RIS相位偏移，最大化毫米波MIMO系统的可达速率，无需完整信道状态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波频谱存在严重信道衰落，需要优化RIS反射元件的相位偏移来增强可达速率。传统优化算法依赖完整准确的信道状态信息，但RIS主要由无源元件组成，难以获取CSI。

Method: 利用无监督学习技术，通过接收的导频信号提供隐式CSI。Capacity-Net建立接收导频信号、优化RIS相位偏移和可达速率之间的映射关系，避免传统信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于Capacity-Net的无监督学习方法优于基于传统信道估计的学习方法。

Conclusion: Capacity-Net提供了一种有效的无监督学习框架，能够在无需完整CSI的情况下优化RIS相位偏移，提高毫米波MIMO系统的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设RIS具有理想的反射特性，但实际中RIS单元的反射幅度和相移之间存在耦合效应，这使得优化问题变得非凸且难以求解。

Method: 采用深度确定性策略梯度(DDPG)的深度强化学习框架，联合优化发射机预编码和RIS相移矩阵，考虑了RIS反射幅度和相移之间的实际耦合效应。

Result: 仿真结果表明，尽管复杂度较高，但所提出的DDPG方法在固定和随机用户数量的实际毫米波信道设置下，显著优于基于优化的算法和双深度Q学习，特别是在随机用户分布场景中。

Conclusion: DDPG方法能够有效处理RIS辅助通信系统中的非凸优化问题，在考虑实际耦合效应的情况下实现更好的频谱效率性能。

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

Motivation: 解决传统OFDM系统在集成感知与通信中的挑战，特别是在任意延迟条件下感知、信道估计和干扰消除的复杂性。

Method: 提出Co-FMCW-OFDM波形，开发了FCCR和DMD两种高效感知算法，基于感知结果开发了感知辅助的有效信道估计方法和干扰消除方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统的嵌入式导频OFDM系统相比，该系统实现了更优的感知精度、改进的信道估计和更低的误码率。

Conclusion: 所提出的Co-FMCW-OFDM系统在集成感知与通信方面表现出优越性能，特别是在任意延迟条件下具有更好的误码率性能。

Abstract: We propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and
communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources.
In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal
and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel
estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we
propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR)
and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)- which significantly reduce system
complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a
realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer
multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number
of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the
sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging.
Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel
estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary
delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an
interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM
demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error
rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The
proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the
conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.

Abstract: Recent studies shows that the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform
is a promising candidate for future communication. To meet users' potential
demand for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications in 6G, the
usage of OTFS for both radar sensing and wireless communication needs to be
explored. In this paper, we propose a Fast Algorithm OTFS radar (FAOR) that can
perform radar sensing in low complexity to detect the range and speed of the
targets. It computes the 2D cyclic correlation of transmitted signal with the
reordered delay Doppler (DD) domain received signals, and then generates the 2D
range-Doppler map. It can be applied not only to monostatic radar but also to
bistatic radar with a much lower computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art radar sensing technology. With the detected time delays and
Doppler frequencies of the targets after the radar sensing, we propose a
pilot-aided channel estimation method. The multifunction pilot symbol can serve
the purpose of both bistatic radar sensing and channel estimation without any
guard symbol added, while reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
considerably compared to the conventional pilot design. The simulation results
show that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared algorithms and gives
decent performance in both radar sensing and channel estimation.

Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to
identify the true hypothesis using as few samples as possible while maintaining
accuracy. The DM collects samples according to its determined actions and knows
the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose the $\Phi$-$\Delta$
algorithm, a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination
algorithm where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards
hypotheses in light of its obtained samples. The DM selects actions based on
maximal separation expressed by the maximal minimal Total Variation Distance
(TVD) between each two possible output distributions. To further optimize the
search (in terms of the mean number of samples required to separate
hypotheses), close distributions (in TVD) are clustered, and the algorithm
eliminates whole clusters rather than individual hypotheses.
  We extensively analyze our algorithm and show it is asymptotically optimal as
the desired error probability approaches zero. Our analysis also includes
identifying instances when the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the
number of hypotheses, bounding the mean number of samples per-stage and in
total, characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing error
rates when clustering hypotheses, evaluating algorithm complexity, and
discussing its optimality in finite regimes.

Conclusion: 这些结果显著推进了插入-删除模型下线性码的研究，使其更接近理论上的半Singleton界，并推广了该界理论。

Abstract: In this work, we study linear error-correcting codes against adversarial
insertion-deletion (indel) errors. While most constructions for the indel model
are nonlinear, linear codes offer compact representations, efficient encoding,
and decoding algorithms, making them highly desirable. A key challenge in this
area is achieving rates close to the half-Singleton bound for efficient linear
codes over finite fields. We improve upon previous results by constructing
explicit codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\), linear over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), with
rate \(1/2 - \delta - \varepsilon\) that can efficiently correct a
\(\delta\)-fraction of indel errors, where \(q = O(\varepsilon^{-4})\).
Additionally, we construct fully linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) with rate
\(1/2 - 2\sqrt{\delta} - \varepsilon\) that can also efficiently correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of
linear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical
half-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every
code \(C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n\) linear over \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{F}\)
a subfield of $\mathbb{F}$, such that \(C\) has the ability to correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\delta)/2$.

Abstract: To increase the information capacity of DNA storage, composite DNA letters
were introduced. We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which
composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite
sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite
resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite
sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution
errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and
upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a
single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code
construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's
capacity, which remains an open problem.

Abstract: We study a joint communication and sensing setting comprising a transmitter,
a receiver, and a sensor, all equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter
sends an encoded signal over the channel with the dual purpose of communicating
an information message to the receiver, and enabling the sensor to estimate a
target parameter vector by generating back-scattered signals. We assume that
the transmitter and sensor are co-located, or fully connected, giving the
latter access to the transmitted signal. The target parameter vector is
randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, yet remains fixed throughout the
transmission block. We establish the fundamental performance trade-off between
the communication and sensing tasks, captured in terms of a capacity-MSE
function. In doing so, we identify optimal coding schemes for this
multi-antenna joint communication and sensing setting. Moreover, we
particularize our result to two practically-inspired scenarios where we
showcase optimal schemes and trade-offs.

Abstract: The problem of PIR in graph-based replication systems has received
significant attention in recent years. A systematic study was conducted by
Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the
storage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates
achievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the
ratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper
makes the following key contributions.
  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study
of PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We
shrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,
  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\le 2/(N+1)$ and
conjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing
the strictly stronger bound $\mathcal{C}(K_N) \le \frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also
improve the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph
$\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$
was $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide
explicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\mathcal{C}(G)
\ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.
  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic
PIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for
reducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of
independent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that
performs particularly well on sparse graphs.
