While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and\nimprove training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by\nreducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive\nscaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between\ntraining convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel\nconditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the\noverall R\\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training\nprocess, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the\nglobal loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we\nobserve that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop\na new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round\nproblems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the\ndynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it\nachieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while\nensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical\nexperiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach\neffectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks without compromising learning performance."}

In this context, it is widely believed that the Ring\nalgorithm for the AllReduce collective communication operation is optimal only\nfor large messages, while Recursive Doubling is preferable for small ones due\nto its logarithmic number of steps compared to the linear number for Ring. In\nthis paper, we challenge this long-held assumption and show that the Ring\nalgorithm can remain optimal even for short messages in ring-based GPU-to-GPU\ntopologies, once realistic propagation delays and link capacity constraints are\naccounted for. We find that the total propagation delay for both Ring and\nRecursive Doubling essentially sums to the same value, but the latter incurs\nsignificantly higher congestion due to longer hop counts, leading to increased\ncompletion times.

To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones.

This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin.
