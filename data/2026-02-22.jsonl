Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%."}

However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods."}

Existing RAN slicing frameworks predominantly rely on per-slice resource reservation, which ensures performance isolation but leads to inefficient utilization, particularly under bursty traffic. We introduce HyRA, a hybrid resource allocation framework for RAN slicing that combines dedicated per-slice allocations with shared resource pooling across slices. HyRA preserves performance isolation while improving resource efficiency by leveraging multiplexing gains in bursty traffic conditions. We formulate this design as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, where the outer loop determines the dedicated and shared resource budgets and the inner loop performs per-UE scheduling under a novel water-filling approach. By using the sample-average approximation, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the inner loop, and Big-M encoding, we transform the problem into a tractable mixed-integer program that standard optimization solvers can solve. Extensive simulations under diverse demand patterns, SLA configurations, and traffic burstiness show that HyRA achieves up to 50-75% spectrum savings compared to dedicated-only and shared-only baselines. These results highlight HyRA as a viable approach for resource-efficient, SLA-compliant RAN slicing in future mobile networks."}

Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms). The M2M latency contributes up to 60% of this value."}

To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates.

This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.

The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work."}

Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\n  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future."}

In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. These results establish a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and publication-facing validation requirements."}

DRP, a contention-based data dissemination protocol, was developed for these applications. Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance.\n  To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays. ML-BSS algorithm predicts future link quality conditions and optimally adjusts the block size for rateless coding, reducing overhead and enhancing goodput. In-field evaluations of EDRP demonstrate an average goodput improvement of 39.43\\% than the competing protocols."}

Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity.

This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making."}

We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings."}

This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a \"Safety Gap\" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models."}

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation."}

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems."}

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%.

(1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish.

We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds."}

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach.

A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\n  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents.

We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization.

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability.

Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions."}

Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination."}

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."}

This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers."}

This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \\emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \\textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \\textbf{Shapley}-weighted \\textbf{D}ecision-\\textbf{C}ritical \\textbf{L}eakage \\textbf{R}ate (\\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \\textbf{Time}-\\textbf{S}upervised \\textbf{P}rediction with \\textbf{E}xtracted \\textbf{C}laims (\\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting."}

Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \\textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs.

Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \\textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \\textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \\textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces.

We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs).

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."}

Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning."}

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."}

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task."}

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements."}

In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios."}

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma."}

Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity.

We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning.

CLEF Evaluation Lab. Registration DL: 2026/04/23. Task Homepage at https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2026/", "summary": "HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ (\"Has the person ever been at this place?\") and $isAt$ (\"Is the person located at this place around publication time?\") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities."}

This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigating latent space misalignment in multi-agent AI- native semantic communications. In a downlink scenario, we consider an access point (AP) communicating with multiple users to accomplish a specific AI-driven task. Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides. Numerical results validate the proposed approach in goal-oriented semantic communication, revealing key trade-offs among accuracy, com- munication overhead, complexity, and the semantic proximity of AI-native communication devices."}

In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations."}
