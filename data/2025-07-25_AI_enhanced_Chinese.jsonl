We describe the methodology for mapping the\niterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose\ndifferent methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is\nproposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball\nwith a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for\nreinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to\nimprove the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list\ndecoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values\nthat substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism\ngroup of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose\na feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing\nhigh-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after\nthe existing decoders.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nPCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PCEnet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u5176\u4ed6\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65e0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPCEnet\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5c06\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u3002", "conclusion": "PCEnet\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

It is, however, very challenging to\nachieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data\nefficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may\nrequire. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly\nadvancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel\nreception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a\ndifferent subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by\nenabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on\nthe same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.\nAdditionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data\nfrom the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data\nparallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the\nset for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive\nconcurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve\napproximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection\nat the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and\nCPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery\nlife and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSNOW\u6280\u672f\u7684LPWAN\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7D-OFDM\u548cGold\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6b65\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LPWAN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b0\u5174\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548cCPS\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6b63\u4ea4\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\uff08D-OFDM\uff09\u548cGold\u7801\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u7ad9\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u4e0a\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6b65\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u5e76\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684SNOW\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7ea69\u500d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository.

Since every condition on a set of finite\ndomain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table\ncan, in principle, simulate any other constraint.

Despite this, it is not uncommon\nto encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that\nare simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based\napproaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the\nstate-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be\nenhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs\nto handle large Table constraints.
