However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission\nefficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep\nSemantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel\ncoding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and\nreceiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder\nand decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts\nmessages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during\nneural network training according to channel characteristics and background\nknowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors.\nSpecifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic\nvectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder\nemploys Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic\nvectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is\nensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the\nentire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the\nTurbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing\nof semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA\nsurpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual\nevaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly\nevident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior\ntext semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine\nchannel environments."}

Compared\nto RSSI-only handover, COHERE reduces the load on the congested RAT by up to\n32%, reduces total handovers by 25%, lowers handovers to the congested RAT by\n55%, and improves link delay by up to 166%, while maintaining comparable or up\nto 11% higher throughput.

This\nproblem arises, for example, in DNA data storage. A common code construction\nuses a concatenated coding scheme that combines an outer linear block code with\nan inner code, which can be either a nonlinear marker code or a convolutional\ncode. Outer decoding is done with Belief Propagation, and inner decoding is\ndone with the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. However, the BCJR\nalgorithm scales exponentially with the number of noisy copies, which makes it\ninfeasible to reconstruct a codeword from more than about four copies. In this\nwork, we introduce BCJRFormer, a transformer-based neural inner decoder.\nBCJRFormer achieves error rates comparable to the BCJR algorithm for binary and\nquaternary single-message transmissions of marker codes. Importantly,\nBCJRFormer scales quadratically with the number of noisy copies. This property\nmakes BCJRFormer well-suited for DNA data storage, where multiple reads of the\nsame DNA strand occur. To lower error rates, we replace the Belief Propagation\nouter decoder with a transformer-based decoder. Together, these modifications\nyield an efficient and performant end-to-end transformer-based pipeline for\ndecoding multiple noisy copies affected by insertion, deletion, and\nsubstitution errors. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-attending\ntransformer architecture called ConvBCJRFormer. This architecture extends\nBCJRFormer to decode transmissions of convolutional codewords, serving as an\ninitial step toward joint inner and outer decoding for more general linear code\nclasses."}

Although these\nadaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent\nevidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness.\nSince different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these\ncritical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their\ntrade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical\nguideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base\nmodel, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both\nsafety and fairness."}

The proof\nbuilds on Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem and relies on an exhaustive search\napproach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length\nuntil a valid code is found.

The system prioritizes\nretrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant\nevidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate\ncandidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked\nanswer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being\nwritten back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and\nprovenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\\_QA dataset show that our hybrid\napproach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla\nRAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm\nthe complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling,\nand the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably\nreduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance,\nadvancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial\nscenarios."}

Building bespoke environments for training is\nheavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs\ncan simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed\ndata or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks:\nSimia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets\ninto diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a\nframework that enables RL training without real environment implementations\nthrough LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent\nimprovements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching\no4-mini on $\\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable\nagent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle\nimplementations with flexible LLM-based simulation."}

While the vast majority of research\nconducted from an experimental perspective is progressing rapidly, it demands\nsubstantial computational power, data, and other resources. Therefore, how to\nopen the black-box of LLMs from a theoretical standpoint has become a critical\nchallenge. This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed\ninformation, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the\ninformation-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of\nsemantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token,\nrather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning. By defining the probabilistic\nmodel of LLMs, we discuss structure-agnostic information-theoretic measures,\nsuch as the directed rate- distortion function in pre-training, the directed\nrate-reward function in post-training, and the semantic information flow in\ninference phase. This paper also delves deeply into the theory of token-level\nsemantic embedding and the information-theoretically optimal vectorization\nmethod. Thereafter, we propose a general definition of autoregression LLM,\nwhere the Transformer architecture and its performance such as ELBO,\ngeneralization error bound, memory capacity, and semantic information measures\ncan be derived theoretically. Other architectures, such as Mamba/Mamba2 and\nLLaDA, are also discussed in our framework. Consequently, this paper provides a\ntheoretical framework for understanding LLMs from the perspective of semantic\ninformation theory, which also offers the necessary theoretical tools for\nfurther in-depth research."}

Recently, Raviv proposed the use of\nrandom linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables\nefficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary\nfor neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under\nnoise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery,\ni.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy\ncompositional representation.\n  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First,\nwe argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable\nfor VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a\nfolklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional\nrepresentations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In\nhistogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given\nas input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length\n$N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an\noptimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related\nto list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience. Our results give\nrise to a noise-resilient VSA with formal guarantees regarding efficient\nencoding, quasi-orthogonality, and recovery, without relying on any heuristics\nor training, and while operating at improved parameters relative to similar\nsolutions such as the Hadamard code."}
