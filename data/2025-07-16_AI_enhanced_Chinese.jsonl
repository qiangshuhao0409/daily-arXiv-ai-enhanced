This study fundamentally questions whether such\nartificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments\nwith the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an\nendogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit\nspontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic\nconvergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external\ninductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that\nthe human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and\nresonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM\ndemonstrates stronger generality and efficiency.

Yet, a pressing\nchallenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot\nsettings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual\nclassification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a\nnon-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodule. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\\% accuracy\nimprovement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,\nachieving 85.63\\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL\ndisplayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with\nvisually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via\niterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision\nagents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable\nmulti-agent AI.

There are potentially\n19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of\nthe grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the\nmutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.\nFollowing the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.\nThe output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original\ntune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple\nmutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are\nused to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the\nsize of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review\nthe musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only\nfocused on generating new pitch sequences.

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial\nemissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where\ntraditional solutions have fallen short.

At predefined timepoints called \"decision points,\"\nintelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions\n(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey\ndata and determine whether and how to intervene.

However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times.

Demand-driven\nnavigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on\nimplicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u547d\u8d77\u6e90\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}
