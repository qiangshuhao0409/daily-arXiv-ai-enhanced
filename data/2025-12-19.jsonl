They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements."}

Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \\emph{security set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \\emph{collusion set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\\mathcal{S}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\\mathcal{T}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates.

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist."}

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR."}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."}

Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively."}

We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}

However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm.

Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution.

These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm.

Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques.

MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}

By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state.

Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent.

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results."}

While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics.

We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence.

In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference."}

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs."}

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference."}

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society."}

Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning", "comment": "Accepted to the ARR October 2025 cycle", "summary": "Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.\n  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education."}

The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems."}

To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods."}

To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care."}

This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling \"last-mile\" navigation challenges."}

Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware."}

The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks."}

Basir"], "title": "The Social Responsibility Stack: A Control-Theoretic Architecture for Governing Socio-Technical AI", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems."}

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning."}

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}
