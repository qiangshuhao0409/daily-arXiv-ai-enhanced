To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link\nsparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce\nscheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network\ncapacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for\nindividual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling\nlinks to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.\nOur approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}\nlearning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing\nscheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.\nIn simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link\nsparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces\nradio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols."}

Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks facilitate dense\ncellular deployments with reduced infrastructure complexity.

At the same\ntime, cell densification makes energy optimization crucial. This paper\naddresses the joint optimization of routing and resource allocation in IAB\nnetworks through two distinct objectives: energy minimization and throughput\nmaximization. We develop a novel capacity model that links power levels to\nachievable data rates. We propose two practical large-scale approaches to solve\nthe optimization problems and leverage the closed-loop control framework\nintroduced by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to integrate\nthe solutions. The approaches are evaluated on diverse scenarios built upon\nopen data of two months of traffic collected by network operators in the city\nof Milan, Italy.

Our primary objective is to maximize the number of\ncompleted tasks while minimizing overall latency, with a particular focus on\nreducing number of dropped tasks. To this end, we investigate both static and\ndynamic versions of an optimization algorithm. The static version assumes full\ntask availability, while the dynamic version manages tasks as they arrive.
