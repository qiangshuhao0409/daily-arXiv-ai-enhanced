It discusses network planning aimed\nat enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional\nfocus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network\ninfrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that\nleverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to\nlocalize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs)\nprovide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning\nrequires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution,\nLOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions.\nTo this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates\nthe need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep\nlearning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the\ntrilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes\nunreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to\nfuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving\nusers across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed\nterrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset,\nfeaturing a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show\nthat the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the\nKITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS\nservices--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for\nGNSS-denied environments."}

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion.

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.
