Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT\nplatforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in\ntimestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level\nresolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide\ninteroperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4\nGHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of\nflight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing\ndatasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not\ntake into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and\nhumidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was\ncollected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes\nlogged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature\nand humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square\nmeter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station\nequipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications.\nThe results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the\ntemperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which\ncalls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental\nfactors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors."}

Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from\ntwo fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all\nusers, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being\nsafe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks\nevolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we\npropose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.\nFirst, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction\nhistory for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,\ngenerating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,\nPSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with\nspecialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,\nMemory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable\nverdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including\nhealthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user\nprofiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including\nLlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward\npersonalized safety for LLM-based agents."}

It\nteaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather\nthan the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical\nlack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation\nshould transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning\nScaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation\nprocess. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a\nsequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)\nthat act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task\nobjective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the\nreasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that\nsignal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the\nstudent to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning.

In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena\ncan be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process\nmaps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology\nremains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This\ntopology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first\ndrives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''\nform, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp\ngrowth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by\nphase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier.

In reality, neither is true since human\npreference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a\ndiscrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which\ncan misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of\neach label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point\nin the training loss to mitigate noise.

We test SciExplorer\non a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,\nand quantum many-body physics.

Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection.

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that\ncompositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target\ntask. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,\nrequiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative\nanalysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the\nmodels. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of\nthese findings.
