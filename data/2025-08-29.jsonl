Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and\nLow Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G\nsystems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use\ncase to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability\nin the range of 99.999\\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two\ntargets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of\nwork have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In\nthis article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are\nanalysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of\nlatency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is\ntaken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross\nlayer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design\nconsideration for various 5G and beyond verticals. Finally the article\nconcludes by providing a detailed discussion on challenges and future outlook\nwith particular focus on the emerging 6G paradigm."}

Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN\nperformance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper\nintroduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov\nDecision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)\nalgorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding\ndecisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of\nunsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation\namong competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a\nlearning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback\nand probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that\nDRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,\nRFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest\nSatisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load\nbalancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and\nheavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational\ncomplexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric\ndecision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading\nto optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent,\nadaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively\naddressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and\nroute optimization in dynamic networking environments."}

However, the practical\nissues of high hardware cost and power consumption pose great challenges\ntowards the cost-effective implementation of XL-MIMO. To address such\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel concept called array configuration\ncodebook (ACC), which enables flexible XL-MIMO cost-effectively and improves\nthe system performance compared with conventional antenna selection (AS)\nschemes with limited number of RF chains. Specifically, ACC refers to a set of\npre-designed array configuration codewords, where each codeword specifies the\npositions of activated antenna pixels. Then, flexible XL-MIMO architecture can\nbe enabled via dynamical pixel activation based on the designed ACC, without\nhaving to exhaustively try all possible combinations of the antenna pixels\nactivations. As an illustration, we give a specific codebook design,\nencompassing the classic compact array (CA), uniform sparse array (USA),\nmodular array (MoA), nested array (NA), and co-prime array (CPA), and each\ncodeword is specified by one array configuration parameter. With the designed\nACC, array configuration training is considered for multi-UE communication to\nmaximize the sum rate. To reduce the training overhead of exhaustive scanning,\na two-stage scanning scheme is proposed, including the array- and pixel-level\nscanning. For comparison, the greedy AS scheme is proposed, where the resulting\nincremental SINR expression by activating antenna pixel sequentially is derived\nin closed-form.

Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when\nstudents had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315\nstudent-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various\nSTEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture\nstudents' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,\nand students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students\nexhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use\nAI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across\ninteractions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting\nstrategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral\nmetrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral\nmechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical\nimplications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It\nemphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's\nfamiliarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be\ndesigned with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.\nUltimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,\nproviding foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching\nAI practices."}

We\npropose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital\nunit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our\nmodel incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven\ndemand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining\nobjective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,\nthe GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,\nnon-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical\nhospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced\nschedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\\%\nperformance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual\nscheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between\ncritical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical\ndecision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators."}

By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the\ntraining loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact\ninference gives access to maximum accuracy.\n  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve\nNP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku\nbenchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a\nfraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut\ntask, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning\nregret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization\nformulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins."}

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for\nmental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically\nvalidated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present\nChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient\nmodeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive\nstrategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational\ninterviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,\nMedium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage\npipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference\noptimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\\% average gain in\npatient motivation, a 0.49\\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves\nhard cases with 26\\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human\nclinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral\nrealism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of\ntherapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research\nand clinical translation."}
