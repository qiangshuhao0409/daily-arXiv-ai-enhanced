Although conventional\nspot trading offers a solution, it frequently leads to excessive overhead due\nto the need for real-time trading related interactions. Likewise, traditional\nfutures trading, which depends on historical data, is susceptible to risks from\nnetwork dynamics. This paper explores a dynamic and uncertain edge network\ncomprising a computing platform, e.g., an edge server, that offers computing\nservices as resource seller, and various types of mobile users with diverse\nresource demands as buyers, including fixed buyers (FBs) and uncertain\noccasional buyers (OBs) with fluctuating needs. To facilitate efficient and\ntimely computing services, we propose an overbooking- and hybrid\ntrading-empowered resource scheduling mechanism with reputation update, termed\nOh-Trust. Particularly, our Oh-Trust incentivizes FBs to enter futures trading\nby signing long-term contracts with the seller, while simultaneously attracting\nOBs to spot trading, enhancing resource utilization and profitability for both\nparties. Crucially, to adapt to market fluctuations, a smart reputation\nupdating mechanism is integrated, allowing for the timely renewal of long-term\ncontracts to optimize trading performance. Extensive simulations using\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Oh-Trust across multiple\nevaluation metrics."}

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for\n$\\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$.

This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent\nin current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often\nmiss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the\nsolution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo\nTree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that\nrely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into\nthe training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit\nassignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,\nDeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,\nwhich leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training\nsteps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that\nprioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with\nentropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)\nadaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.\nExperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves\n62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B\nreasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training\napproaches.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling.

We apply this to a realistic web-based\nshopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,\nall of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent\ndecisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that\nagents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive\nconstraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and\nopportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human\nbiases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a\nbehavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human\nbehavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable\nevaluation of agent decision-making."}

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

While recent advances have focused on\nlarge language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work\nrevisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,\nwhich offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to\nontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE\nmethods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a\nfew models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem\nover merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular\nframework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse\nKGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns\nentities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We\nevaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets\nspanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material\nScience and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings\nemerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce\nhigh-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich\nand multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this\nconservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence\nmappings.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence.

By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex\nconstructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more\ninterpretable AI evaluation."}

To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we\noptimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to\nenhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily\non complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often\nchallenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.\nTo circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with\nimplicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually\nrequires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of\nthe current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of\nchannel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among\nthe received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant\nachievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning\nmethods based on traditional channel estimation."}

Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical\ncoupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for\nthe RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated\nunder both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel\nsettings.

In this paper, to\ncope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a\ndigital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service\nprovision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices,\nwe first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate\nimpact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data\ntraffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively\nenable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing\nnon-stationary data traffic.

Agents\ndynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and\nleverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed\nagreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into\nstrategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored.
