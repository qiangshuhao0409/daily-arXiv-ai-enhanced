However,\ncurrent data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static\ndatasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG\nsystems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based\nsystems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading\nIT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively\nderive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG\nsystems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.\nOur findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ\nframeworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are\nconcentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality\nmanagement strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the\nRAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality\nmanagement."}

However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit\nthis inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that\nDLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising\nprocess and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows\nthat if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate\nstep, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in\naligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can\nreadily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nvulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed\non DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method\ntailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from\ncontaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens.

A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,\nas agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This\nexpansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior\nwork on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow\napplications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified\nframework that optimally compresses both environment observations and\ninteraction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON\nleverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given\npaired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,\ncapable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is\nupdated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM\ncompressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.\nExperiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON\nreduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task\nperformance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller\ncompressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%\nperformance improvement."}

We frame this\nproblem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer\na specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,\nwe model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's\nmulti-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that\nseparates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To\nlearn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network\nthat couples model- and query-level embeddings.

However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be\ngenerated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and\nleaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.\nThis is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used\nin all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose\nBridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched\nLLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only\na small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean\naccuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%\nand boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any\ngeneration width, all with greater performance than independent generations,\nunlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages\ninformation between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation\ntechnique."}

Despite its\nsignificance, no systematic study has characterized the performance of existing\nAI video chat systems. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive\nbenchmark with carefully designed metrics across four dimensions: quality,\nlatency, internal mechanisms, and system overhead. Using custom testbeds, we\nfurther evaluate five mainstream AI video chatbots with this benchmark. This\nwork provides the research community a baseline of real-world performance and\nidentifies unique system bottlenecks. In the meantime, our benchmarking results\nalso open up several research questions for future optimizations of AI video\nchatbots."}

Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited,\nespecially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers\ncommonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are\ndeployed in real environments. We propose a hybrid approach leveraging transfer\nlearning to combine simulated and real-world data. Using RouteNet-Fermi, we\nshow that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset\nsignificantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom\ntestbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay\nprediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and\nwith 50 scenarios, by 48%."}
