We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{>}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services."}

In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \\emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples."}

The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems."}

Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration. Using moment generating functions, we then derive closed-form expressions for average and peak AoI for an arbitrary number of sources. Moreover, we introduce a worst-case constrained attack model and employ stochastic dominance arguments to establish analytical AoI bounds.

Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor.

We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary."}

In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."}

In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles."}

To accommodate this demand with limited hardware resources, beam hopping (BH) has emerged as a prominent approach in LEO SATCOM. However, its time-domain switching mechanism confines coverage to a small fraction of the service area during each time slot, exacerbating uplink throughput bottlenecks and latency issues as the user density increases. Meanwhile, wideband systems experience the beam-squint effect, where analog beamforming (BF) directions vary with subcarrier frequencies, potentially causing misalignment at certain frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of wideband SATCOM. In this paper, we aim to shift the paradigm in wideband LEO SATCOM from beam-squint as an impairment to beam-squint as an asset. Specifically, we put forth 3D rainbow BF employing a joint phase-time array (JPTA) antenna with true time delay (TTD) to intentionally widen the beam-squint angle, steering frequency-dependent beams toward distributed directions. This novel approach enables the satellite to serve its entire coverage area in a single time slot. By doing so, the satellite simultaneously receives uplink signals from a massive number of users, significantly boosting throughput and reducing latency. To realize 3D rainbow BF, we formulate a JPTA beamformer optimization problem and address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem through a novel joint alternating and decomposition-based optimization framework. Through numerical evaluations incorporating realistic 3D LEO SATCOM geometry, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed rainbow BF-empowered LEO SATCOM achieves up to 2.8-fold increase in uplink throughput compared to conventional BH systems. These results mark a significant breakthrough for 6G wideband LEO SATCOM."}

In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs."}

In FELKH-3D, the challenge of infinite charging direction space is solved by designing an algorithm generating a minimum-size direction set guaranteed to be FuncEqv to the infinite set of whole sphere surface, and the optimaility of the method was proved.To determine the optimal charging tour for the UAV, the LKH algorithm is employed.Simulation experiments demonstrated the superiority of FELKH-3D over other classical algorithms."}

The DM may abort an in-progress action, yielding no sample, by truncating its realized cost at a smaller, tunable deterministic limit, which we term a per-action deadline. We analyze how this cancellation option can be exploited under two cost-revelation models: ex-post, where the cost is revealed only after the sample is obtained, and ex-ante, where the cost accrues before sample acquisition.\n  In the ex-post model, per-action deadlines do not affect the expected total cost, and the cost-error tradeoffs coincide with the baseline obtained by replacing deterministic costs with cost means. In the ex-ante model, we show how per-action deadlines inflate the expected number of times actions are applied, and that the resulting expected total cost can be reduced to the constant-cost setting by introducing an effective per-action cost. We characterize when deadlines are beneficial and study several families in detail."}

Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.\n  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets."}

We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions.

The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios.

CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties.

In the rectangular setting, where a single rank-one component typically generates multiple informative outliers, we further propose a procedure for combining these outliers under mild non-Gaussian signal assumptions.

Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a \"Persistent Agent\" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life."}

We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\\% and 235\\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user.

To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities.

The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary."}

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor."}

On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition."}

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems."}

This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD."}

Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost."}

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints."}

However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.\n  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding."}

We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away from modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space."}

However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation. We trained the models on a dataset containing the behavior of a pair of monkeys, their rewards, and the conditioned stimuli. Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions. The ECM achieved the highest classification score in the Rand Index (0.88 vs. 0.79 for the IPM) under our settings, suggesting that social comparison relies on objective reward differences rather than inferences about subjective states."}

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change."}

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science."}

CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks.

However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space."}

Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities."}

To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs.

Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it.

In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $γ(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty.

We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment.

While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. This work provides a new perspective on reasoning chain quality assessment and offers guidance for future optimization."}

We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories."}

Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur.

Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources. We fine-tune open-source LLMs, Llama 3.1 8B and OpenCoder 8B, on structured datasets derived from real-world application scenarios and evaluate the generated plausibility checks on previously unseen forgery patterns.

If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals. The result is that the latter two successfully learn general policies on large planning instances with sparse rewards by automatically creating a curriculum of easier goals of increasing complexity. The experiments illustrate the computational gains of these versions, their limitations, and opportunities for addressing them."}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize."}

This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation."}

By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness.

However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding."}

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines."}

This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel \"Asymmetry of Discovery.\" When applied to customer churn prediction, we demonstrate that automated rule learners (GLRM) excel at identifying broad \"Safety Nets\" (retention patterns) but struggle to capture specific \"Risk Traps\" (churn triggers)-a phenomenon we term the Anna Karenina Principle of Churn. By initialising the explanation matrix with automated safety rules and augmenting it with a Pareto-optimal set of just four human-defined risk rules, our approach achieves 94.00% predictive accuracy. This configuration outperforms the full 8-rule manual expert baseline while reducing human annotation effort by 50%, proposing a shift in the paradigm for Human-in-the-Loop AI: moving experts from the role of \"Rule Writers\" to \"Exception Handlers.\""}

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment."}
