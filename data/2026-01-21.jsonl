However, classical LiNGAM methods rely on the strong assumption that there exists an ordering under which the noise terms are exactly independent, an assumption that is often violated in the presence of confounding. In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal order estimation that remains applicable under arbitrary confounding. Rather than imposing independence as a hard constraint, we quantify the degree of confounding by the multivariate mutual information among the noise variables. This quantity is decomposed into a sum of mutual information terms along a causal order and is estimated using Bayesian marginal likelihoods. The resulting criterion can be interpreted as Bayesian ICA for causal discovery, where causal order selection is formulated as a model selection problem over permutations. Under standard regularity conditions, we show that the proposed Bayesian mutual information estimator is consistent, with redundancy of order $O(\\log n)$. To avoid non-identifiability caused by Gaussian noise, we employ non-Gaussian predictive models, including multivariate $t$ distributions, whose marginal likelihoods can be evaluated via MCMC. The proposed method recovers classical LiNGAM and DirectLiNGAM as limiting cases in the absence of confounding, while providing a principled ranking of causal orders when confounding is present. This establishes a unified, confounding-aware, and information-theoretically grounded extension of ICA-based causal discovery."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods."}

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds.

For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement.

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios."}

We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines.

Moreover, we characterize the achievable computation rate and show that the proposed hierarchical constellations can compute R output functions with decoding error probability epsilon while the gap to the optimal computation rate scales as O(\\log_2(1/ε)/K) for independent source symbols, where K denotes the number of transmitters.

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment."}

While the ubiquity and low cost of commodity Wi-Fi make it an ideal platform for wide-scale sensing, it is the continuous evolution of Wi-Fi standards-towards higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays-that fundamentally unlocks the physical resources required for high-performance ISAC. To structure this rapidly expanding field, numerous surveys have appeared. However, prevailing literature predominantly adopts a top-down perspective, emphasizing upper-layer applications or deep learning models while treating the physical layer as an opaque abstraction. Consequently, these works often fail to touch the bottom layer of signal formation and lack technical guidance on overcoming the physical barriers that constrain sensing performance. To bridge this gap, this tutorial takes a bottom-up approach, systematically analyzing the sensing gains brought by Wi-Fi advancements through the lens of physical-layer diversity. We organize the framework around four orthogonal dimensions: i) Temporal Diversity addresses synchronization gaps to enable absolute ranging; ii) Frequency Diversity expands the effective bandwidth to sharpen range resolution; iii) Link Diversity leverages distributed topologies and digital feedback to achieve ubiquitous observability; and iv) Spatial Diversity utilizes multi-antenna arrays to combine passive angular discrimination with active directional control. Collectively, these orthogonal dimensions resolve fundamental ambiguities in time, range, and space, bridging physical capabilities with challenging sensing diversities. By synthesizing these dimensions, this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for \"ISAC-izing\" commodity Wi-Fi, paving the way for future standardization and robust deployment."}

During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\\varrho\\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\\varrho \\in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network.

Three experienced qualitative researchers conducted ITA-GPT assisted analyses of interview transcripts from education research in the Ghanaian teacher education context. The tool supported familiarization, verbatim in vivo coding, gerund-based descriptive coding, and theme development, while enforcing trace to text integrity, coverage checks, and auditability. Data sources included interaction logs, AI-generated tables, researcher revisions, deletions, insertions, comments, and reflexive memos. Findings show that ITA-GPT functioned as a procedural scaffold that structured analytic workflow and enhanced transparency. However, interpretive authority remained with human researchers, who exercised judgment through recurrent analytic actions including modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting. The study demonstrates how inductive thematic analysis is enacted through responsible human AI collaboration."}

Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost."}

By mutually sharing physical sites, radio elements, licensed spectrum and other parts of the RAN infrastructure, participating operators can significantly reduce the capital (and operational) expenditure in deploying and operating cellular networks, while accelerating coverage expansion -- thereby addressing the spectrum scarcity and infrastructure cost challenges in the 5G era and beyond. While the economic benefits of RAN sharing are well understood, the impact of such resource pooling on user-perceived performance remains underexplored, especially in real-world commercial deployments. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical measurement study of commercial 5G spectrum and RAN sharing. Our measurement study is unique in that, beyond identifying real-world instances of shared 5G spectrum and RAN deployment \"in the wild\", we also analyze users' perceived performance and its implication on Quality of Experience (QoE). Our study provides critical insights into resource management (i.e., pooling) and spectrum efficiency, offering a blueprint (and implications) for network evolution in 5G, 6G and beyond."}

Lawrence"], "title": "The Origin of the Inaccessible Game", "comment": null, "summary": "The inaccessible game is an information-geometric framework where dynamics of information loss emerge from maximum entropy production under marginal-entropy conservation.\n  We study the game's starting state, the origin. Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.\n  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c>0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.\n  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent \"modular energy\"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics."}

To address the limitations of existing approaches in handling dynamic demands and predicting users' implicit intents, in this paper we propose an edge service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework empowered by a Generative Intent Prediction Agent (GIPA). Our GIPA aims to shift the paradigm from passive execution to proactive prediction and orchestration. First, we construct a multidimensional intent space that includes functional preferences, QoS sensitivity, and resource requirements, enabling the mapping from unstructured natural language to quantifiable physical resource demands. Second, to cope with the complexity and randomness of intent sequences, we design an intent prediction model based on a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM), which reconstructs users' implicit intents from multidimensional context through a reverse denoising process. Finally, the predicted implicit intents are embedded as global prompts into the SFC orchestration model to guide the network in proactively and ahead-of-time optimizing SFC deployment strategies. Experiment results show that GIPA outperforms existing baseline methods in highly concurrent and highly dynamic scenarios."}

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

We are interested in the asymptotic relationship of $m$ and $n$: given $n$, how large can $m$ be (asymptotically), such that the value of the Boolean function can be recovered reliably? This problem generalizes the identification-via-channels framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck.

However, user mobility creates highly dynamic service demands in edge networks, and existing service scheduling agents often lack generalization capabilities for new scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Intent-Driven General Agentic AI (IGAA) framework. Leveraging a meta-learning paradigm, IGAA enables AAI to continuously learn from prior service scheduling experiences to achieve generalized scheduling capabilities. Particularly, IGAA incorporates three core mechanisms. First, we design a Network-Service-Intent matrix mapping method to allow agents to simulate novel scenarios and generate training datasets. Second, we present an easy-to-hard generalization learning scheme with two customized algorithms, namely Resource Causal Effect-aware Transfer Learning (RCETL) and Action Potential Optimality-aware Transfer Learning (APOTL). These algorithms help IGAA adapt to new scenarios. Furthermore, to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual IGAA learning, we propose a Generative Intent Replay (GIR) mechanism that synthesizes historical service data to consolidate prior capabilities. Finally, to mitigate the effect of LLM hallucinations on scenario simulation, we incorporate a scenario evaluation and correction model to guide agents in generating rational scenarios and datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate IGAA's strong generalization and scalability. Specifically, IGAA enables rapid adaptation by transferring learned policies to analogous new ones, such as applying latency-sensitive patterns from real-time computing to optimize novel Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services. Compared to scenario-specific methods, IGAA maintains the intent-satisfaction rate gap within 3.81%."}

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications."}

First, we establish precise bounds on the minimum rank distance of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes under two distinct parameter regimes. Specifically, when $n_{1}=k_{1}$ and $n_{2}=m<n_{1}n_{2}$, the minimum rank distance is exactly $n_{2}-k_{2}+1$. This yields a new family of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes, which are distinct from classical Gabidulin codes. For the case of $k_{1}\\leq n_{1},k_{2}\\leq n_{2},n_{1}n_{2}\\leq m$, the minimum rank distance $d$ of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes satisfies a tight upper and lower bound, i.e., $n_{2}-k_{2}+1 \\leq d \\leq (n_{1}-k_{1}+1)(n_{2}-k_{2}+1)$. Second, we introduce a new class of decodable rank-metric codes, namely Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker product (EGK) codes, which generalize the structure of Gabidulin-Kronecker product (GK) codes. We also propose a decoding algorithm that directly retrieves the codeword without recovering the error vector, thus improving efficiency. This algorithm achieves zero decoding failure probability when the error weight is within its correction capability. Third, we propose three enhanced variants of the RQC cryptosystem based on EGK codes, each offering a distinct trade-off between security and efficiency. For 128-bit security, all variants achieve significant reductions in public key size compared to the Multi-UR-AG (Bidoux et.al., IEEE IT, 2024) while ensuring zero decryption failure probability--a key security advantage over many existing rank-based schemes."}

This paper proposes an interoperable rApp/xApp-driven dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) framework for O-RAN, based on a graph-theoretic formulation of physical resource block (PRB) assignment. The proposed architecture leverages a non-real-time radio intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) rApp to predict aggregated traffic evolution and generate high-level spectrum policies at the minutes timescale, while a near-real-time RIC (Near-RT RIC) xApp constructs a user-centric conflict graph and performs fairness-aware PRB allocation at sub-second timescales. To mitigate persistent user starvation, a conflict-aware modified proportional fair (MPF) scheduling mechanism is applied, enabling controlled interference-free PRB time-sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the PRB assignment success rate (above 90%) and service-share fairness (above 85%) across different channel configurations and user demands, while maintaining architectural separation and rApp/xApp interoperability in accordance with O-RAN principles."}

These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity.

However, the performance of Starlink networks in mobility settings, particularly with frequent changes in the UT's orientation, and the impact of environmental factors, such as transient obstructions, has not been thoroughly studied, leaving gaps in understanding the causes of performance degradation. Recently, researchers have started identifying the communicating satellites to evaluate satellite selection strategies and the impact on network performance. However, existing Starlink satellite identification methods only work in stationary, obstruction-free scenarios, as they do not account for UT mobility, obstructions or detect dynamic beam switching events. In this paper, we reveal that the UT can perform multiple dynamic beam switching attempts to connect to different satellites when the UT-satellite link is degraded. This degradation can occur either due to the loss of line-of-sight (LoS) from changes in the FOV or obstructions, or due to poor signal quality, extending UT-satellite handovers beyond the well-known 15-second regular handover interval. We propose a mobility-aware Starlink satellite identification method that detects dynamic beam switching events, and plausibly explain network performance using UT's diagnostic data and connected satellite information. Our findings demystifies the mobile Starlink network performance degradations, which is crucial to enhance the end-to-end performance of transport layer protocols and in diverse application scenarios."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

Open RAN enables programmability through xApps, yet deploying and validating these applications is critical given the nature of the systems they aim to control. Current Open RAN ecosystems lack robust lifecycle management of xApps that enable automated testing, seamless migration, and production-grade observability, resulting in slow, error-prone xApp delivery. To address these issues, DevOps practices can streamline the xApp lifecycle by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with advanced traffic management and monitoring, such as leveraging service mesh technologies to enable progressive deployment strategies (e.g., canary releases and A/B testing) to ensure fine-grained observability and resilience. The solution presented in this article, MANATEE (Mesh Architecture for Radio Access Network Automation and TEsting Ecosystems), is the first platform that combines these principles to simplify xApp delivery into production, accelerate innovation, and guarantee performance across heterogeneous O-RAN environments. We prototyped MANATEE on a Kubernetes cluster integrated with the O-RAN Software Community Near-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as with service mesh technologies, to facilitate testing of xApps across simulated, emulated, and real testbed environments.

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct."}

The mechanical adjustment provides wide-angle coverage but suffers from slow response, while the electronic tuning enables rapid beam reconfiguration but with limited angular range. To effectively combine their complementary advantages, we propose to jointly design both mechanical and electronic configurations to maximize the average sum-rate of users via a two-timescale optimization approach, in which the array positions are optimized on the long timescale according to large-scale user distribution statistics, and the pattern selection vectors are optimized on the short timescale to enable fast beam alignment based on the instantaneous user locations. An alternating optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo sampling method is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed design achieves significant performance gains over various benchmark schemes."}

While this level of abstraction has enabled a rich body of results, it limits the ability to represent structural dependencies that are central in many structured argumentation formalisms, in particular subargument relations. Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning."}

To analyze its asymptotic behavior, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). We show that, the statistical properties of the considered scheme can be asymptotically characterized by a scalar ``signal plus Gaussian noise'' model. Based on this, we further derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) in the large-system limit, which quantitatively characterizes the impact of both system and model parameters on SEP performance.

We assume that the instantaneous knowledge of the transmit signal at the sensing receiver is not available, and the sensing receiver only has knowledge of the statistical properties of the received signal. Unlike prior research that focuses on power allocation or optimal beamforming design for ISAC, we emphasize the inadequacy of the Cramér-Rao Bound (and its variant) in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, particularly in passive sensing scenarios. Due to severe path loss and other impairments, the received sensing SNR is often significantly lower than that of direct Line-of-Sight communication, making CRB-based performance evaluation unreliable. To address this, we adopt the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for Angle of Arrival estimation, which provides a more meaningful lower bound on estimation error. We derive analytical expressions for the ZZB and the achievable ergodic communication rate as functions of SNR. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the pareto-front between communication and sensing performance, demonstrating why ZZB serves as a better metric in low sensing SNR ISAC where traditional CRB-based approaches fail."}

Our main results identify two distinct regimes depending on the error magnitude.

Despite growing interest in LLM safety, existing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks remain largely general-purpose and fail to capture the domain-specific risks inherent to real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts."}

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations.

Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations.

Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency.

Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations."}

Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.\n  Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%. These gains are further amplified under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, where VCC's ability to offload interference mitigation to the receivers ensures robust performance even in the face of degraded CSI quality and elevated acquisition costs."}

Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

This removes one degree of freedom that would otherwise require a symbolic guess, reducing the number of inactivated variables and decreasing the size of the final linear system that must be solved. We further show that dual peeling combined with standard peeling alone, without inactivation, is sufficient to achieve ML for erasure decoding of surface codes. Simulations across several QLDPC code families confirm that our decoder matches ML logical failure performance while significantly reducing the complexity of inactivation decoding, including more than a 20% reduction in symbolic guesses for the B1 lifted product code at high erasure rates."}

We study review-to-action generation: producing concrete, implementable recommendations grounded in review text. We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity.

However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans.

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate.

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD.

Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS.

In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent.

To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness.

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications."}

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations.

To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space.

This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development.

However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

We create and analyze a Journalist-provided Deepfake Dataset (JDD) of 255 public deepfakes which were primarily contributed by over 70 journalists since early 2024. We also generate a synthetic audio dataset (SYN) of dead public figures and propose a novel Context-based Audio Deepfake Detector (CADD) architecture. In addition, we evaluate performance on two large-scale datasets: ITW and P$^2$V. We show that sufficient context and/or the transcript can significantly improve the efficacy of audio deepfake detectors. Performance (measured via F1 score, AUC, and EER) of multiple baseline audio deepfake detectors and traditional classifiers can be improved by 5%-37.58% in F1-score, 3.77%-42.79% in AUC, and 6.17%-47.83% in EER. We additionally show that CADD, via its use of context and/or transcripts, is more robust to 5 adversarial evasion strategies, limiting performance degradation to an average of just -0.71% across all experiments.

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics."}

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare."}

Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench.

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential."}

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks.

We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research.

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs.

We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

A Tokyo-Based Pilot Study Using Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Environments", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper introduces Virtual Urbanism (VU), a multimodal AI-driven analytical framework for quantifying urban identity through the medium of synthetic urban replicas. The framework aims to advance computationally tractable urban identity metrics. To demonstrate feasibility, the pilot study Virtual Urbanism and Tokyo Microcosms is presented. A pipeline integrating Stable Diffusion and LoRA models was used to produce synthetic replicas of nine Tokyo areas rendered as dynamic synthetic urban sequences, excluding existing orientation markers to elicit core identity-forming elements. Human-evaluation experiments (I) assessed perceptual legitimacy of replicas; (II) quantified area-level identity; (III) derived core identity-forming elements. Results showed a mean identification accuracy of ~81%, confirming the validity of the replicas. Urban Identity Level (UIL) metric enabled assessment of identity levels across areas, while semantic analysis revealed culturally embedded typologies as core identity-forming elements, positioning VU as a viable framework for AI-augmented urban analysis, outlining a path toward automated, multi-parameter identity metrics."}

However, the capabilities of current LLMs in this setting remain unclear due to the lack of systematic benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LifeAgentBench, a large-scale QA benchmark for long-horizon, cross-dimensional, and multi-user lifestyle health reasoning, containing 22,573 questions spanning from basic retrieval to complex reasoning. We release an extensible benchmark construction pipeline and a standardized evaluation protocol to enable reliable and scalable assessment of LLM-based health assistants. We then systematically evaluate 11 leading LLMs on LifeAgentBench and identify key bottlenecks in long-horizon aggregation and cross-dimensional reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we propose LifeAgent as a strong baseline agent for health assistant that integrates multi-step evidence retrieval with deterministic aggregation, achieving significant improvements compared with two widely used baselines. Case studies further demonstrate its potential in realistic daily-life scenarios. The benchmark is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LifeAgentBench-CE7B."}

However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments."}

Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions. While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden). Importantly PREFAB improves annotator confidence without degrading annotation quality."}

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem. We release Numina-Lean-Agent and all solutions at https://github.com/project-numina/numina-lean-agent."}

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

To address these limitations, we introduce $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed $\\textbf{RebuttalBench}$ and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process.

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

We offer an enriched, 3GPP-compliant data source that enhances the dynamic, context-aware fulfillment of network operator goals, along with an MCP tools server for scheduling, monitoring, and analytics tools.
