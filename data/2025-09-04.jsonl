However, this flexibility\nalso introduces significant challenges for existing successive cancellation\n(SC) based decoding schemes. Motivated by the need for a general SC decoding\nsolution, we present a comprehensive decoding strategy for monotone chain polar\ncodes that can handle arbitrary numbers of terminals, non-binary alphabets, and\ndecoding along arbitrary monotone chains. Specifically, we formulate the SC\ndecoding task as a series of inference subtasks over the polar transform and\npropose a computational graph framework based on probability propagation\nprinciples. This approach highlights the impact of variable switching during\ndecoding and shows that time complexity varies between $O(N\\log{N})$ and\n$O(N^2)$, depending on the specific chain structure. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the widely used $O(N)$ space optimization is not universally applicable to\nmonotone chain polar codes, which prompts us to introduce a constant-time\ndecoder forking strategy based on the proposed logical computation graphs. This\nstrategy enables time-efficient list decoding without relying on $O(N)$-space\ntechniques. Numerical results verify the superior performance of the proposed\nscheme compared with the classical lazy-copy scheme."}

To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber\ncommunication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and\nDisassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS\npolicies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS\ndependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41\ndependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause\ncommunication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2\npackage that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts,\nand enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2\nsession. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight\nand a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations,\nimproving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic\nsystems."}

In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics\nprimarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a\npredefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and\nits strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based\non three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation\nintensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.\nWe demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased\nrandom selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,\nthis trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics\non three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.\nThe same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,\ncommonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany\nseveral recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this\napproach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC\nbenchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs."}

Therefore, accountability\nbecomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory\nbodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and\nfocus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a\nknowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term\naccountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on\nthe actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI\naccountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges\nthe gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for\nAI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of\naccountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a\nthree-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our\naccountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and\nthe mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.\nMoreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI\nsystem to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our\nframework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared\ndependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should\nfoster collaborations.
