### [1] [A Full-Stack Platform Architecture for Self-Organised Social Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01239)
*Matthew Scott,Jeremy Pitt*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源的全栈架构，旨在通过民主化平台开发来支持本地社区的自组织社会协调，从而缓解平台化的垄断倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解平台化的集中化和垄断趋势，赋能本地社区通过自组织实现社会协调。

Method: 开发一个支持分发、克隆、生成性和多种托管选项的开源全栈架构，包括元平台、基础平台、库和插件。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（体育协会平台和集体学习平台）验证了该架构的可行性。

Conclusion: 通过全栈架构和配套工具链，可以在应用层实现自组织社会协调。

Abstract: To mitigate the restrictive centralising and monopolistic tendencies of
platformisation, we aim to empower local communities by democratising platforms
for self-organised social coordination. Our approach is to develop an
open-source, full-stack architecture for platform development that supports
ease of distribution and cloning, generativity, and a variety of hosting
options. The architecture consists of a meta-platform that is used to
instantiate a base platform with supporting libraries for generic functions,
and plugins (intended to be supplied by third parties) for customisation of
application-specification functionality for self-organised social coordination.
Associated developer- and user-oriented toolchains support the instantiation
and customisation of a platform in a two-stage process. This is demonstrated
through the proof-of-concept implementation of two case studies: a platform for
regular sporting association, and a platform for collective group study. We
conclude by arguing that self-organisation at the application layer can be
achieved by the specific supporting functionality of a full-stack architecture
with complimentary developer and user toolchains.

Abstract: With the rapid development of aerial infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) that function as aerial base stations (ABSs) extend terrestrial network
services into the sky, enabling on-demand connectivity and enhancing emergency
communication capabilities in cellular networks by leveraging the flexibility
and mobility of UAVs. In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates
position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate
inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages
ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.
Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial
beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In
this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions,
revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel
correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an
alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for
ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate
of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark
to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS
rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in
interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can
significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and
improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\% compared to
fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.

### [3] [Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication with Intent-Aware Semantic-Splitting Multiple Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01333)
*Jiayi Lu,Wanting Yang,Zehui Xiong,Rahim Tafazolli,Tony Q. S. Quek,Mérouane Debbah,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多用户生成语义通信（SS-MGSC）框架，通过意图感知共享知识库和扩散模型生成个性化内容，优化语义提取和波束成形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式人工智能的发展，语义通信成为高效可靠通信的新范式。本文旨在解决多用户内容分发中的多样化需求。

Method: 构建意图感知共享知识库，广播公共语义信息，个性化分发私有信息，并使用扩散模型生成高质量图像。采用强化学习优化语义提取和波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明所提方案的有效性。

Conclusion: SS-MGSC框架在多用户语义通信中实现了高效个性化内容分发。

Abstract: With the booming development of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a new paradigm for reliable and
efficient communication. This paper considers a multi-user downlink SemCom
system, using vehicular networks as the representative scenario for multi-user
content dissemination. To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we
propose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting
multiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an
intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of
semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the
common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the
private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver
side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate
high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and
perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric
as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint
optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved
using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in
high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme.

### [4] [MmBack: Clock-free Multi-Sensor Backscatter with Synchronous Acquisition and Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360)
*Yijie Li,Weichong Ling,Taiting Lu,Yi-Chao Chen,Vaishnavi Ranganathan,Lili Qiu,Jingxian Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: mmBack是一种低功耗、无时钟的反向散射标签，支持多传感器同步数据采集和复用，通过单调制链实现高效数据传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反向散射标签设计仅支持单传感器，增加了空间开销；而多传感器复用方案依赖时钟或多调制链，增加了成本和尺寸，且易受时间漂移影响。

Method: mmBack利用共享参考信号同步传感器输入，设计电压分配方案复用多传感器数据，并通过频率跟踪算法和有限状态机实现解复用。

Result: mmBack原型支持5个5kHz带宽或3个18kHz带宽的并发传感器流，平均信噪比超过15dB。

Conclusion: mmBack提供了一种高效、低功耗的多传感器同步数据采集解决方案，适用于复杂传感任务。

Abstract: Backscatter tags provide a low-power solution for sensor applications, yet
many real-world scenarios require multiple sensors-often of different types-for
complex sensing tasks. However, existing designs support only a single sensor
per tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to
multiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or
multiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain
prone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.
  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables
synchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single
modulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared
reference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for
an onboard timing source. To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs
a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter
frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver,
mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for
accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its
prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz
and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz. Evaluation shows
that mmBack achieves an average SNR surpassing 15dB in signal reconstruction.

### [5] [Frontiers of Generative AI for Network Optimization: Theories, Limits, and Visions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01773)
*Bo Yang,Ruihuai Liang,Weixin Li,Han Wang,Xuelin Cao,Zhiwen Yu,Samson Lasaulce,Mérouane Debbah,Mohamed-Slim Alouini,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文综述了生成式AI在网络优化中的应用，重点分析了生成扩散模型（GDMs）和大规模预训练模型（LPTMs）的优缺点，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在网络优化中的潜力与局限性，填补现有文献中对模型内在限制的不足。

Method: 通过分类网络优化问题为一击优化和马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并分析GDMs和LPTMs的应用与理论泛化界限。

Result: 揭示了生成式AI在约束满足、概念理解和输出概率性等方面的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在网络优化中具有潜力，但需进一步研究其理论与实际应用的结合。

Abstract: While interest in the application of generative AI (GenAI) in network
optimization has surged in recent years, its rapid progress has often
overshadowed critical limitations intrinsic to generative models that remain
insufficiently examined in existing literature. This survey provides a
comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We
focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion
models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion
around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems
into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision
process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions
from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization.
We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking
tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical
generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering
insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most
importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general
capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We
highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint
satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic
nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the
gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly
integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and
underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their
theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured
overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of
GenAI in network optimization.

### [6] [Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)
*Iñaki Dellibarda Varela,Pablo Romero-Sorozabal,Eduardo Rocon,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文澄清了关于大型推理模型（LRMs）是否具备真正推理能力的争议，通过复制和改进两项基准测试（汉诺塔和河流穿越），发现LRMs在复杂任务中表现有限，但在可解问题中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI社区对LRMs是否具备真正推理能力的争议，澄清先前研究的结论是否准确。

Method: 复制并改进两项基准测试（汉诺塔和河流穿越），引入逐步提示和协作对话方法。

Result: LRMs在汉诺塔任务中因认知限制失败（如8个圆盘时），但在可解的河流穿越任务中表现优异（如100+代理对）。

Conclusion: LRMs是离散状态空间中的随机搜索器，真正的符号推理进展需通过精细实验进一步探索。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

### [7] [Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282)
*Matthew JY Kang,Wenli Yang,Monica R Roberts,Byeong Ho Kang,Charles B Malpas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但实际临床贡献有限，尤其在痴呆症诊断和护理中。混合方法结合统计学习和专家知识可提升可解释性。未来研究需关注临床工作流和患者结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在临床诊断中的实际贡献，特别是在痴呆症领域，以解决当前LLM在临床实践中未能显著提升诊断效果的问题。

Method: 通过范围综述，分析AI在临床环境中的局限性，并提出混合方法（统计学习与专家知识结合）以提升可解释性和实用性。

Result: 发现LLM在临床应用中存在透明度低、易产生幻觉和因果推理弱等问题。混合方法（如PEIRS和ATHENA-CDS）更符合临床工作流。

Conclusion: 未来AI决策支持需结合神经符号或混合AI，强调解释性和临床实用性，同时关注人类交互改进。

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

Conclusion: LLM-Agents、MLLM-Agents和Agentic AI为智能制造开辟了新途径，但需进一步明确其定义、能力边界和解决潜在挑战。

Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within
dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI),
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension,
complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise
of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and
complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents
(MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in
information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous
decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the
definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these
emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this
gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent
technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of
LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

### [12] [Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)
*Yanfei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架Agent-as-tool，将工具调用过程与推理过程分离，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究同时处理工具调用和推理过程，导致模型负担过重，影响推理能力。

Method: 采用分层框架，由一个代理处理工具调用，另一个专注于推理过程。

Result: 仅需少量强化学习微调（180样本），在Bamboogle上表现优异（63.2%精确匹配，75.2%覆盖精确匹配）。

Conclusion: Agent-as-tool框架有效减轻模型负担，显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模训练与测试样本的分布偏移和负采样质量上存在不足。

Method: 提出T3DM方法，结合测试时训练指导的分布偏移建模和对抗训练生成高质量负样本。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法，结果更优且更稳健。

Conclusion: T3DM通过改进分布偏移建模和负采样策略，显著提升了TKG推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work,
we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用店内顾客作为配送员的集中式众包配送系统，提出了一种结合MDP、NeurADP和DDQN的动态优化策略，显著降低了配送成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对城市地区最后一公里配送效率的需求增长，探索利用零售场景中的顾客作为配送员的潜力。

Method: 提出基于MDP的模型，结合NeurADP进行订单分配和DDQN进行动态定价，实现多目的地路由和不确定性管理。

Result: 实验显示，NeurADP + DDQN策略比固定定价节省6.7%，比短视基线节省18%；灵活延迟和多目的地路由进一步降低成本8%和17%。

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了回答集语义的通用原则，质疑了最小模型属性、约束单调性和基础性是否应为强制条件，并提出了基于Gelfond原则的改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究回答集语义的通用原则，以解决现有条件可能过于严格的问题，并探索更合理的语义定义。

Method: 通过例子说明现有条件的局限性，改进Gelfond的回答集原则，定义新的语义，并分析计算复杂性。

Result: 提出了基于改进原则的新语义，并验证其合理性，同时评估现有语义的适用性。

Conclusion: 改进的Gelfond原则为回答集语义提供了更灵活的框架，同时保持了逻辑的一致性和可计算性。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer架构的AI原生基础模型，用于统一且与编码无关的解码，解决了6G网络中传统解码器缺乏灵活性和可扩展性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要支持多样化的通信场景，传统解码器无法满足灵活性和可扩展性需求。

Method: 提出了CrossMPT（交叉注意力消息传递Transformer）和其扩展版本FCrossMPT及CrossED，通过跨注意力块和集成解码器实现高性能解码。

Result: CrossMPT在单神经解码器中达到最先进性能，FCrossMPT和CrossED进一步提升了泛化能力和解码性能。

Conclusion: 提出的AI原生解码器具有灵活性、可扩展性和高性能，为6G网络的信道编码提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of
requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands
challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and
scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we
propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding
based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention
message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked
cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input
representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to
effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved
state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on
this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture
invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to
decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding
performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT
ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel
CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture
can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across
diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder
offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising
direction to channel coding for 6G networks.

### [18] [On Securing Berrut Approximated Coded Computing Through Discrete Cosine Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01330)
*Rimpi Borah,J. Harshan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了SBACC（Secure Berrut Approximated Coded Computing），一种针对不可信工作节点的安全编码计算方法，扩展了BACC的功能，并引入了新的评估点选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BACC方法虽然能容忍近似误差，但缺乏对不可信工作节点的安全性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用编码理论方法，提出SBACC框架，利用DCT码实现错误检测和纠正，并优化评估点选择。

Result: 推导了SBACC在无不可信节点时的准确性界限，并针对存在不可信节点的情况提出了优化问题。

Conclusion: SBACC不仅抗延迟，还能抵御不可信节点，为编码计算提供了更高的安全性和准确性。

Abstract: Coded computing is a reliable and fault-tolerant mechanism for implementing
large computing tasks over a distributed set of worker nodes. While a majority
of coded computing frameworks address accurate computation of the target
functions, they are restricted to computing multivariate polynomial functions.
To generalize these computing platforms to non-polynomial target functions,
Jahani-Nezhad and Maddah-Ali recently proposed Berrut Approximated Coded
computing (BACC), which was proven fault-tolerant against stragglers albiet
with tolerable approximation errors on the target functions. Despite these
benefits, there is no formal study on the security of BACC against worker nodes
which report erroneous computations. To fill this research gap, we use a
coding-theoretic approach to propose Secure Berrut Approximated Coded Computing
(SBACC), which is resilient to stragglers and also robust to the presence of
such untrusted worker nodes. One of the highlights of SBACC is the new choice
of evaluation points for distributed computation which makes the well-known
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) codes amenable to error detection and
correction. To validate the new choice of evaluation points, first, we derive
bounds on the accuracy of SBACC in the absence of untrusted worker nodes.
Subsequently, to handle the presence of untrusted worker nodes, we derive
bounds on the accuracy of SBACC and show that interesting optimization problems
can be formulated to study the trade-off between the error correcting
capability of the DCT codes and the accuracy of the target computation.

TL;DR: SCADF-MoE是一种基于软混合专家框架的空间上下文感知动态融合网络，用于解决6G ISAC定位中的多模态指纹贡献变化和模糊性问题，实现了频率鲁棒的亚米级定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态指纹在6G ISAC定位中至关重要，但贡献随频率变化和空间模糊性限制了其部署。

Method: 通过聚类邻近点形成轨迹注入空间上下文，利用可学习的MoE路由器动态融合多模态信息，并通过模态任务MoE同时回归轨迹顶点坐标和质心。

Result: 在三个真实城市布局和三个载波频段上，模型实现了亚米级MSE，并将未见的NLOS误差减半。

Conclusion: SCADF-MoE是首个利用大规模多模态MoE实现频率鲁棒ISAC定位的工作。

Abstract: Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block
deployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position
varies with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii)
spatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy,
especially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we
introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a
soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points
into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively
fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain
through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at
each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that
simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and
its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an
auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates
gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban
layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent
sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our
knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for
frequency-robust ISAC localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SK方案在高斯噪声信道中效率高，但对CSI敏感，难以直接应用于衰落信道。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在SK型编码器中引入模格函数和辅助信号，以消除不完美CSI导致的解码错误。

Result: 成功设计出适用于准静态衰落信道的SK型编码方案，解码错误被完美消除。

Conclusion: 本文为不完美CSI和量化反馈下的衰落信道提供了一种高效编码方案设计方法。

Abstract: The classical Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) scheme for the additive Gaussian noise
channel with noiseless feedback is highly efficient since its coding complexity
is extremely low and the decoding error doubly exponentially decays as the
coding blocklength tends to infinity. However, its application to the fading
channel with imperfect CSI at the transmitter (I-CSIT) is challenging since the
SK scheme is sensitive to the CSI. In this paper, we investigate how to design
SK-type scheme for the quasi-static fading channel with I-CSIT and quantized
feedback. By introducing modulo lattice function and an auxiliary signal into
the SK-type encoder-decoder of the transceiver, we show that the decoding error
caused by the I-CSIT can be perfectly eliminated, resulting in the success of
designing SK-type scheme for such a case. The study of this paper provides a
way to design efficient coding scheme for fading channels in the presence of
imperfect CSI and quantized feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统JSDM方案依赖复杂的矩阵分解实现有效信道矩阵的块对角化，而RIS能够重塑无线环境，从而简化这一过程。

Method: 通过将RIS放置在基站的离散傅里叶变换（DFT）方向上，建立正交视距链路，设计预波束成形；基于用户分组优化RIS反射波束方向，减少组间干扰；推导信道互相关系数近似值用于RIS与用户关联。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法不仅实现了有效信道块对角化，还显著提升了多用户传输的总频谱效率。

Conclusion: RIS定制的JSDM方案简化了传统复杂过程，同时提升了性能，为多用户场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the unique capability to
reshape the radio environment, thereby simplifying transmission schemes
traditionally contingent on channel conditions. Joint spatial division and
multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for
multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix
decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix.
In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to
customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By
strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight
links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming
design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with
optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs
channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is
derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further
diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the
efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel
block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral
efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.

Method: 通过重新编码整个耦合序列而非分散耦合位到多个时间点的组件编码器中，简化耦合结构。

Result: 理论及数值结果表明，所提码在性能上优于现有空间耦合码，且耦合记忆可低至2。

Conclusion: 所提出的HSC-BCCs和HSC-PCCs在简化结构的同时，性能接近容量，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a new class of spatially coupled turbo-like codes
(SC-TCs), namely half spatially coupled braided convolutional codes (HSC-BCCs)
and half spatially coupled parallel concatenated codes (HSC-PCCs). Different
from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic
coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by
re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time
instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of
multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window
decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed
codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as
small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate
the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially
coupled codes.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of a simultaneous transmitting and
reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided
medium-Earth-orbit (MEO) satellite network for providing both global
positioning services and communication services in the urban canyons, where the
direct satellite-user links are obstructed. Superposition coding (SC) and
successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the
integrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed
navigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground
users or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application
needs, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have
been developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors.
We then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA)
and communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or
communication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized
position dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The
effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by
analyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating
communication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our
satellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the
urban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally,
it is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational
link, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in
the current system design.

TL;DR: 论文研究了低复杂度调制方案（MASK和MPSK）在共生反向散射通信（SBC）中的应用，推导了PT和BD的速率表达式，并通过优化相位设计提升了PT的速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统假设BD信号为CSCG分布不适用于低成本BD，因此研究低复杂度调制方案（MASK/MPSK）以提升实际性能。

Method: 推导了PT和BD的速率表达式，并通过优化MASK/MPSK的相位设计最大化PT的速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，BD是否提升PT速率取决于MASK/MPSK的相位，而BD速率与相位无关；仿真显示低阶ASK优于低阶PSK。

Conclusion: 优化MASK/MPSK的相位可提升PT速率，低阶ASK在直接链路不显著弱于反向散射链路时表现更优。

Abstract: Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient
and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs)
modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary
transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric
complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may
not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not
supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by
investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary
amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's
signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the
achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK
modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first
derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results
reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase
of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We
then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting
the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive
the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation
results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an
improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is
better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate,
especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the
backscatter link in SBC.

Abstract: To mitigate the loss of satellite navigation signals in urban canyons and
indoor environments, we propose an active simultaneous transmitting and
reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (ASTARS) empowered satellite
positioning approach. Deployed on building structures, ASTARS reflects
navigation signals to outdoor receivers in urban canyons and transmits signals
indoors to bypass obstructions, providing high-precision positioning services
to receivers in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. The path between ASTARS and the
receiver is defined as the extended line-of-sight (ELoS) path and an improved
carrier phase observation equation is derived to accommodate that. The receiver
compensates for its clock bias through network time synchronization, corrects
the actual signal path distance to the satellite-to-receiver distance through a
distance correction algorithm, and determines its position by using the least
squares (LS) method. Mathematical modeling of the errors introduced by the
proposed method is conducted, followed by simulation analysis to assess their
impact. Simulation results show that: 1) in areas where GNSS signals are
blocked, with time synchronization accuracy within a 10 ns error range, the
proposed method provides positioning services with errors not exceeding 4 m for
both indoor and outdoor receivers, outperforming conventional NLoS methods with
positioning errors of more than 7 m; 2) the additional errors introduced by the
proposed method do not exceed 3 m for time synchronization errors within 10 ns,
which includes the phase shift, beamwidth error, time synchronization errors,
and satellite distribution errors, outperforming traditional NLoS methods,
which typically produce positioning errors greater than 5 m.

Conclusion: 该研究为无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统在大规模网络中的实际部署提供了可行性参考。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a
prominent candidate for future networks due to its ability to significantly
enhance spectral efficiency by eliminating inter-cell interference. However,
its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high
computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To
address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a
sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the
connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to
significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high
performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the
trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate
that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and
complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original
MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing
insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale
network.
