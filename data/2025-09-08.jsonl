While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL).

To address this challenge, we aim\nto develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial\nbehaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with\none's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator\nthat promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,\ncontext-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'\ngoals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by\nmaximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We\nevaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,\nKeys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that\nstate-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of\ncommunicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -\nleading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM\nprovides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,\nshorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users."}

Although\npreliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the\nlanguage's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.\nIn this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that\nis based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and\nis aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).\nBuilding on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,\nwe also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting\nequivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies."}

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.
