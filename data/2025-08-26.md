Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technologies has established cellular
networks as the backbone for diverse applications, each with distinct quality
of service requirements. Meeting these varying demands within a unified
infrastructure presents a critical challenge that can be addressed through
advanced techniques such as multi-connectivity. Multiconnectivity enables User
equipments to connect to multiple BSs simultaneously, facilitating QoS
differentiation and provisioning. This paper proposes a QoS-aware
multi-connectivity framework leveraging machine learning to enhance network
performance. The approach employs deep neural networks to estimate the
achievable QoS metrics of BSs, including data rate, reliability, and latency.
These predictions inform the selection of serving clusters and data rate
allocation, ensuring that the User Equipment connects to the optimal BSs to
meet its QoS needs. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm significantly enhances Quality of Service (QoS) for applications
where traditional and state-of-the-art methods are inadequate. Specifically,
the algorithm achieves a QoS success rate of 98%. Furthermore, it improves
spectrum efficiency by 30% compared to existing multi-connectivity solutions.

### [2] [Comparison of FTN-NOFDM and PCS-OFDM for Long-Haul Coherent Optical Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17350)
*Haide Wang,Ji Zhou,Yongcheng Li,Weiping Liu,Changyuan Yu,Xiangjun Xin,Liangchuan Li*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出FTN-NOFDM技术提升400G相干光通信频谱效率，通过非正交子载波和ICI消除技术，在2000km传输中展现出优异的非线性容限和WSS滤波容限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单波长400G相干光通信面临频谱效率低、占用带宽大的问题，需要开发更高频谱效率的调制技术来满足爆炸性增长的流量需求。

Method: 采用8子载波的FTN-NOFDM技术，使用修剪逆FFT和ICI消除生成信号，提出基于频率音调的定时恢复方法，设计时域MIMO均衡器和LDPC辅助的迭代检测来抑制ICI。

Result: 在11级125GHz WSS和2000km传输实验中，FTN-NOFDM展现出与PCS-OFDM相当的WSS滤波容限和更优的非线性容限，但PCS-OFDM的误码率性能最佳。

Conclusion: FTN-NOFDM是提升长距离相干光通信频谱效率的有效方案，特别在非线性环境下表现优异，为400G光通信系统提供了有竞争力的技术选择。

Abstract: Single-wavelength 400G coherent optical communications have become a critical
solution to meet the explosive traffic demands. However, the single-carrier
modulation using low-order modulation formats requires a broader wavelength
division multiplexing grid and expands the occupied optical bandwidth. In this
paper, we propose the faster-than-Nyquist non-orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (FTN-NOFDM) to improve the spectral efficiency for long-haul
coherent optical communications. The subcarrier number is set to eight to
enable low-complexity FTN-NOFDM signal generation using a pruned inverse fast
Fourier transform and inter-carrier interference (ICI) cancellation. To deal
with the conventional timing recovery (TR) failure, a frequency tone-based TR
is proposed for FTN-NOFDM. A time-domain multiple-input multiple-output
equalizer is designed to update the tap coefficients based on outputs of
conventional iterative detection (ID). To further mitigate ICI, a low-density
parity check-assisted ID is integrated into the conventional ID module.
FTN-NOFDM, probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS)-OFDM, and quadrature phase
shift keying-OFDM are experimentally compared in a 400G coherent optical
communication system over 11 cascaded 125-GHz wavelength-selective switches
(WSSs) and 2000 km transmission. Results show that the FTN-NOFDM exhibits
comparable WSS filtering tolerance to PCS-OFDM and superior nonlinearity
tolerance, while PCS-OFDM achieves the best bit error ratio performance.

### [3] [Optimizing Anonymity and Efficiency: A Critical Review of Path Selection Strategies in Tor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17651)
*Siddique Abubakr Muntaka,Jacques Bou Abdo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文比较了Tor网络中五种路径选择策略的性能，发现地理优化策略延迟最低，拥塞感知策略吞吐量最佳，没有单一策略在所有场景下最优，但针对性选择能显著提升性能而不影响匿名性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Tor网络规模扩大和使用模式演变，默认的带宽加权随机选择和持久守卫节点策略面临性能限制，需要评估不同路径选择策略的效果。

Method: 使用基于TorPS的高保真仿真模型，在五种网络规模下模拟37,500个电路，比较随机、守卫、拥塞感知和两种地理策略（多样性驱动和延迟优化）的性能。

Result: 地理（延迟优化）策略实现最低延迟（40.0 ms）和最高效率，拥塞感知策略提供最佳吞吐量，比基线提升42%，守卫节点在大网络中延迟增加。

Conclusion: 针对性路径选择能显著改善Tor性能而不损害匿名性，为未来电路构建优化提供指导，不同策略在不同使用场景下各有优势。

Abstract: The Onion Router (Tor) relies on path selection algorithms to balance
performance and anonymity by determining how traffic flows through its relay
network. As Tor scales and usage patterns evolve, default strategies such as
bandwidth-weighted random selection and persistent guard nodes face increasing
performance limitations. This study presents a comparative evaluation of five
path selection strategies: Random, Guard, Congestion-Aware, and two Geographic
approaches (Diversity Driven and Latency-Optimized) using a high-fidelity
simulation model inspired by TorPS (Tor Path Simulator). Experiments were
conducted across five network scales, simulating 37,500 circuits under
realistic relay conditions. Results show that Geographic (Latency-Optimized)
consistently achieved the lowest latency (40.0 ms) and highest efficiency,
while Congestion-Aware strategies delivered the best throughput, outperforming
the baseline by up to 42%. Guard nodes maintained stable routing but exhibited
latency increases under larger networks. No single method proved optimal across
all scenarios, but each revealed clear strengths for specific use cases. These
findings demonstrate that targeted path selection can significantly improve
Tor's performance without compromising anonymity, providing guidance for
optimizing circuit construction in future development and deployments.

### [4] [Sustainability or Survivability? Eliminating the Need to Choose in LEO Satellite Constellations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17763)
*Chris Misa,Ramakrishnan Durairajan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 基于太阳同步轨道的SS-plane设计方案，通过与地球日夜周期对齐，可将卫星数量减少一个数量级，辐射暴露降低23%，实现更可持续的低地球轨道卫星网络设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低地球轨道卫星网络(LSNs)依靠数万颗卫星引发了可持续性和生存性问题，其设计忽视了互联网流量的时空结构特征和近地空间环境的物理现实。

Method: 提出了一种基于太阳同步(SS)轨道的新题SS-plane设计方法，通过将卫星覆盖范围与地球日夜周期进行对齐来优化设计。

Result: SS-plane星座组与传统Walker-delta星座组相比，可将所需卫星数量减少一个数量级，并且能够将辐射暴露降低约23%。

Conclusion: 这一研究建议LSN领域应进行范式转变，从大型可丢弃的巨型星座组转向更具可持续性和有目标性的低地球轨道星座组设计。

Abstract: LEO Satellite Networks (LSNs) are revolutionizing global connectivity, but
their reliance on tens of thousands of satellites raises pressing concerns over
sustainability and survivability. In this work, we argue that the
inefficiencies in LSN designs stem from ignoring the strong spatiotemporal
structure of Internet traffic demand (which impacts sustainability) and the
physical realities of the near-Earth space environment (which affects
survivability). We propose a novel design approach based on sun-synchronous
(SS) orbits called SS-plane, which aligns satellite coverage with the Earth's
diurnal cycle. We demonstrate that SS-plane constellations can reduce the
number of satellites required by up to an order of magnitude and cut radiation
exposure by ~23% compared to traditional Walker-delta constellations. These
findings suggest a paradigm shift in LSN research from large, disposable
megaconstellations to more sustainable, targeted LEO constellations.

### [5] [Real World Assets on-Chain Assistance Low-Altitude Computility Networks: Architecture, Methodology, and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17911)
*Haoxiang Luo,Ruichen Zhang,Yinqiu Liu,Gang Sun,Hongfang Yu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 将低空飞行器的计算能力作为代币化实物资产进行区块链交易，构建低空计算网络，提升任务延迟、信任保障和资源效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济网络中无人机和eVTOL等飞行器的计算资源需要高效共享和可信协调，传统方式难以实现分布式设备的协同计算

Method: 采用区块链技术将物理硬件和计算输出代币化为RWA资产，设计架构整合飞行器群组为安全互操作的计算网络，并通过案例模拟验证

Result: 模拟结果显示基于RWA协调的任务延迟改善、信任保障增强和资源效率提升

Conclusion: 代币化计算资源为低空经济网络提供了可行的解决方案，未来需研究AI驱动编排、边缘AI卸载和跨辖区政策等问题

Abstract: Low-altitude airspace is becoming a new frontier for smart city services and
commerce. Networks of drones, electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL)
vehicles, and other aircraft, termed Low-Altitude Economic Networks (LAENets),
promise to transform urban logistics, aerial sensing, and communication. A key
challenge is how to efficiently share and trust the computing utility, termed
computility, of these aerial devices. We propose treating the computing power
on aircraft as tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) that can be traded and
orchestrated via blockchain. By representing distributed edge computing
resources as blockchain tokens, disparate devices can form Low-Altitude
Computility Networks (LACNets), collaborative computing clusters in the sky. We
first compare blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and RWA
frameworks to clarify how physical hardware and its computational output can be
tokenized as assets. Then, we present an architecture using blockchain to
integrate aircraft fleets into a secure, interoperable computing network.
Furthermore, a case study models an urban logistics LACNet of delivery drones
and air-taxis. Simulation results indicate improvements in task latency, trust
assurance, and resource efficiency when leveraging RWA-based coordination.
Finally, we discuss future research directions, including AI-driven
orchestration, edge AI offloading and collaborative computing, and
cross-jurisdictional policy for tokenized assets.

### [6] [Digital Twin Assisted Proactive Management in Zero Touch Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17941)
*Tamizhelakkiya K,Dibakar Das,Komal Sharma,Jyotsna Bapat,Debabrata Das*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将数字孪生(DT)与零接触网络(ZTN)相结合的架构，使用Few-Shot学习和Q-learning来实现端到端网络的主动带宽管理和智能决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着蜂窝网络的快速扩张和对高质量服务需求的增长，需要高效自主的网络管理解决方案，以减少人工干预并提高服务可靠性。

Method: 集成数字孪生与ZTN架构，应用Few-Shot学习到记忆增强的BiLSTM模型来预测网络状态，并使用Q-learning确定最优动作（如流量整形）以满足QoS要求。

Result: 仿真结果表明，网络能够适应底层变化条件，DT辅助的ZTN相比其他技术实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 数字孪生与零接触网络的集成能够有效实现网络自主管理和智能决策，在三种不同场景下均表现出良好的适应性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cellular networks and rising demand for high-quality
services require efficient and autonomous network management solutions. Zero
Touch Network (ZTN) management has emerged as a key approach to automating
network operations, minimizing manual intervention, and improving service
reliability. Digital Twin (DT) creates a virtual representation of the physical
network in realtime, allowing continuous monitoring, predictive analytics, and
intelligent decision-making by simulating what-if scenarios. This paper
integrates DT with ZTN proactive bandwidth management in end-to-end (E2E)
next-generation networks. The integrated architecture applies Few-Shot Learning
(FSL) to a memoryaugmented Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model
to predict a new network state to augment the known and trained states. Using
Q-learning, it determines the optimal action (e.g. traffic shaping) under
varying network conditions such that user Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
are met. Three scenarios have been considered: 1) normal ZTN operation with
closed-loop control, 2) a what-if scenario of DT, and 3) network state unknown
to DT. The simulation results show that the network can adapt to underlying
changing conditions. In addition, DT-assisted ZTN achieves better performance
than the other techniques.

### [7] [Automating Conflict-Aware ACL Configurations with Natural Language Intents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17990)
*Wenlong Ding,Jianqiang Li,Zhixiong Niu,Huangxun Chen,Yongqiang Xiong,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Xumi是一个基于LLM的ACL配置自动化系统，能够将自然语言意图转换为ACL规则，检测并解决规则冲突，优化部署方案，显著提升配置效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ACL配置依赖人工操作，过程繁琐、易出错且难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案来降低操作复杂度

Method: 利用LLM结合领域知识自动翻译自然语言意图为ACL规则，检测新旧规则冲突并生成解决方案，优化部署计划最小化规则添加

Result: 评估显示Xumi比现有方法加速配置流程10倍以上，处理数百个冲突ACL，在现代云网络中减少约40%的规则添加

Conclusion: Xumi通过LLM驱动的自动化方法有效解决了ACL配置的复杂性问题，大幅提升了网络配置的效率和可靠性

Abstract: ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet
its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To
carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new
configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules,
(2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3)
deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts
for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone,
and impractical to scale.
  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge
of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural
language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts.
Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and
generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally
identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while
satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire
configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses
O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud
network.

### [8] [PowerChain: Automating Distribution Grid Analysis with Agentic AI Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094)
*Emmanuel O. Badmus,Peng Sang,Dimitrios Stamoulis,Amritanshu Pandey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PowerChain是一个基于LLM的智能代理系统，用于自动化配电网分析工作流，通过自然语言查询生成专家级分析流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配电网运营规划日益复杂，但传统分析方法需要专业知识且难以自动化，小型电力公司缺乏研发资源无法规模化使用先进分析工具

Method: 开发PowerChain系统，利用LLM函数调用功能，基于专家构建的电力系统函数池和参考工作流-查询对，动态生成和执行有序的分析函数序列

Result: PowerChain能够使用GPT-5和开源Qwen模型在真实电力数据上处理复杂的未知配电网分析任务，生成专家级工作流

Conclusion: 该智能代理系统成功解决了配电网分析自动化的难题，为资源有限的电力公司提供了可扩展的先进分析能力

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

### [9] [Revisiting Rule-Based Stuttering Detection: A Comprehensive Analysis of Interpretable Models for Clinical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16681)
*Eric Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强的基于规则的口吃检测框架，在保持完全可解释性的同时实现了竞争性性能，特别在延长音检测方面表现出色（97-99%准确率），并展示了如何将可解释模型与现代机器学习管道集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口吃影响全球约1%人口，虽然深度学习在自动语音不流畅检测方面取得进展，但在临床应用中，可解释性和透明度至关重要，基于规则的方法仍然不可或缺。

Method: 提出了增强的基于规则框架，包含说话速率归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，分析了UCLASS、FluencyBank和SEP-28k等多个语料库。

Result: 在延长音检测方面达到97-99%的准确率，在不同说话速率下提供稳定性能，虽然神经网络在无约束设置中可能获得略高的准确率，但基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势。

Conclusion: 基于规则的系统在临床环境中具有重要价值，特别是在决策可审计性、患者特定调优和实时反馈至关重要的场景中，可以作为现代AI系统与传统语音病理学实践之间的桥梁。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

*Liu Liu,Rui Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用可解释AI技术分析PISA 2018数据，随机森林模型在数学成绩预测中表现最佳，关键预测因素包括社会经济地位、学习时间、教师动机和学生态度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别影响学生数学表现的关键因素，为设计有效教育政策提供依据。

Method: 使用多重线性回归、随机森林、CATBoost和人工神经网络四种模型，基于PISA 2018数据对67,329名学生进行分析，采用特征重要性、SHAP值和决策树可视化等XAI技术保证模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了成绩预测的非线性和上下文依赖性，显示了XAI在教育研究中的价值，为政策改革和个性化学习策略提供支持。

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

### [11] [Evaluation and LLM-Guided Learning of ICD Coding Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16777)
*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Wuraola Oyewusi,Kai Kang,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对ICD编码模型的解释性进行了系统性评估，提出了基于忠实度和合理性的双重视角评估框架，构建了新的标注数据集，并探索了基于LLM生成解释的远程监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习ICD编码模型缺乏可解释性，现有方法主要依赖注意力机制和定性评估，缺乏系统性评估标准和高质量标注数据集，以及专门训练生成解释的方法。

Method: 1) 构建新的标注数据集，提供更密集的多粒度标注；2) 从忠实度(反映模型真实推理)和合理性(与专家判断一致性)两个维度评估解释性；3) 提出基于LLM生成解释的远程监督学习方法，使用带/不带标注示例的LLM提示生成解释作为监督信号。

Result: LLM生成的解释与人类专家判断最为接近；加入少量人工标注示例不仅能进一步提升解释生成质量，还能增强解释学习方法的效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为ICD编码模型的解释性提供了系统性评估框架，证明了LLM生成解释的有效性，并为提升医疗AI系统的透明度和可信度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU加速学习环境只能提供固定游戏集合的硬编码实现，缺乏对多样化、人类相关任务的动态支持，需要一种能够表达丰富游戏空间的新引擎。

Method: 基于流行的PuzzleScript在线游戏引擎设计领域特定语言(DSL)，支持动态编译任何可表达的游戏，并验证了数百个自2013年以来专业设计师和普通创作者设计的游戏。

Result: PuzzleJAX能够自然表达既简单直观又极具挑战性的任务，需要控制、规划和高层次洞察力的结合，为搜索、学习和语言模型提供了丰富的测试基准。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX成功覆盖了广泛、表达力强且与人类相关的任务空间，为AI算法的基准测试提供了有价值的工具，展示了其在复杂推理任务评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

### [13] [Route-and-Execute: Auditable Model-Card Matching and Specialty-Level Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839)
*Shayan Vassef,Soorya Ram Shimegekar,Abhay Goyal,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种医疗专业的视觉-语言模型框架，用于编排临床工作流，通过单一模型既能路由图像到专业模型，又能执行多个下游任务，减少部署复杂性并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床工作流分散且效率低下，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化输出交付，导致运营成本高。

Method: 采用单一视觉-语言模型（VLM）在两种补充角色中：1）作为模型卡片匹配器通过三阶段工作流路由图像；2）细调在专业数据集上执行多任务。包含提前退出机制和选择器检查。

Result: 在消化内科、血液科、眼科和病理学领域，单模型部署表现等同或接近专门基线模型，而且能够减少数据科学家工作量、简化监控、提高选模透明度并降低集成成本。

Conclusion: 这种"一个VLM既能决策又能执行"的方法为临床工作流提供了更高效、更简洁的解决方案，有望改善医疗AI系统的可部署性和可维护性。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用贝叶斯框架来量化LLM中的奉承行为，通过测量与理性行为的偏差来区分合理和不合理的观点更新，解决了传统方法在无真实标签任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过行为变化或准确率来衡量奉承行为，但无法表征理性变化，且准确率方法仅适用于有真实标签的场景。需要一种能处理不确定性任务且无需真实标签的量化方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将奉承行为定义为当呈现用户观点时与理性行为的偏差。研究3个不同任务、多个开源和闭源LLM，使用两种奉承探测方法和多种概率判断诱发技术。

Result: 发现：1）LLM不具备贝叶斯理性；2）奉承探测导致预测后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3）奉承有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下减少误差；4）贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性弱。

Conclusion: 仅研究奉承对真实标签的影响不能完全捕捉推理错误，贝叶斯框架能更好地量化奉承行为，特别是在无真实标签或不确定性任务中。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图表分析中缺乏透明度，无法显示推理过程中使用了图表的哪些部分，这限制了实际应用中的可信度和采用率。

Method: 提出RADAR半自动方法构建基准数据集，包含图表、问题、推理步骤和归因标注；引入基于图表数学推理的归因方法。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

TL;DR: 无限但有限制的论证框架在计算复杂性方面表现出令人惊讶的特性：有限性假设本身不保证复杂性降低，但对于基于可接受性的语义，存在组合约束导致复杂性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无限但有限制的论证框架的计算复杂性，这些框架具有足够的表达能力来建模各种推理场景，同时保持计算可处理性。

Method: 分析无限但有限制的论证框架（每个论证只被有限个其他论证攻击）的计算问题复杂性，特别关注基于可接受性语义的组合约束。

Result: 发现有限性假设本身不自动降低复杂性，但对于可接受性语义存在显著的组合约束，导致复杂性大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有限无限论证框架为推理提供了自然设置，在表达能力和计算可处理性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于许多推理场景的分析。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

Motivation: 传统两阶段方法将学习组件与经典求解器分离，破坏了优化一致性，可能降低解的质量

Method: 提出GaS框架，在联合训练过程中整合强化学习和最优分割算法，采用LSTM增强模型处理部分可观测性

Result: 大量实验表明GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性方面显著优于现有学习方法

Conclusion: GaS框架通过联合优化强化学习和分割算法，有效解决了多旅行商最小最大路径问题，具有优异的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Conclusion: 价值对齐研究需要更全面的理论来涵盖人类价值的全谱系，多智能体系统为解决价值多元化和冲突提供了有效框架，未来研究应关注长期推理和适应性价值实现。

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了MaRVL-QA基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在数学曲面图上的深度数学和空间推理能力，发现当前最先进模型表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已很成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有挑战。数学曲面图提供了一个无语义噪声的测试环境来评估这些核心推理能力

Method: 创建MaRVL-QA基准测试，包含两个新任务：拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换）。通过精心筛选的函数库生成测试数据

Result: 评估显示即使最先进的多模态大语言模型也表现困难，经常依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: PosterGen框架成功模拟了专业海报设计师的工作流程，能够生成语义准确且视觉吸引人的学术海报，大大减少了研究人员的时间投入。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在具身导航中缺乏结构化的空间记忆，只能进行反应式操作，限制了在复杂真实环境中的泛化能力和适应性。

Method: BSC-Nav框架从自我中心轨迹和上下文线索构建异中心认知地图，并动态检索与语义目标对齐的空间知识，与多模态大语言模型集成。

Conclusion: BSC-Nav提供了一个可扩展且基于生物学基础的路径，为实现通用空间智能提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

performance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85). Sample-based
CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms

Conclusion: 该系统成功将离线策略转变为持续、 clinician监督的系统，具有清晰的控制和快速适应能力

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Motivation: 机器学习在高风险决策中应用日益广泛，需要透明可解释的结果，但传统解释方法可能泄露专有算法，需要在透明性和算法保护之间找到平衡

Method: 使用模型无关的可解释规则替代模型来近似黑盒模型，生成对原始黑盒模型有利的对抗样本，并通过因果依赖关系优化成本计算，只考虑用户主动改变的特征

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的对抗建议，同时具有更低的成本

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the
"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2:

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 当前基于符号回归或大语言模型的物理定律发现方法局限于单模态数据，忽视了丰富的视觉运动表征，这种"感官剥夺"限制了它们解释动态现象中时空模式的能力。

Method: 采用Motion Structure Induction (MSI)课程训练，通过监督微调解释运动相图，使用Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT)构建假设，并通过Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC)用强化学习优化公式结构。推理时主动调用外部符号回归工具进行Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2)。

Conclusion: 该模型成功模拟了科学发现过程，整合了视觉感知和符号推理，为从多模态观测数据中发现物理定律提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Motivation: 研究LLMs在结构化数据上的函数逼近能力，探索其在小规模数据集上无需微调即可完成分类、回归和聚类任务的潜力。

Method: 评估多个先进LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4o等）在少样本提示下的性能，并与传统机器学习基线（线性模型、集成方法、表格基础模型）进行比较。

Result: LLMs在分类任务中表现强劲，特别是在数据有限的情况下；但在回归任务中表现不佳，聚类结果也有限制。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为结构化数据的通用预测引擎，在分类方面有明显优势，但在回归和聚类方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Result: 实验结果显示CARL算法在现有基准测试中比最先进方法多解决了50%的问题

Conclusion: CARL算法通过求解无约束SSP子问题的方式，为约束随机最短路径问题提供了更有效的解决方案，显著提升了问题求解能力

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective

TL;DR: Spacer是一个科学发现系统，通过'刻意去情境化'方法将信息分解为关键词单元，从关键词间未探索的连接中获取创造力，自动生成原创科学概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM系统要么局限于狭窄任务范围，要么受限于有限的创造力。需要开发能够自主产生创造性且事实基础扎实的科学概念的系统。

Method: 系统由Nuri灵感引擎和Manifesting Pipeline组成：Nuri从18万篇生物领域论文构建的关键词图中提取新颖关键词集；Manifesting Pipeline通过链接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性来生成科学陈述。

Result: Nuri的评估指标AUROC得分0.737准确分类高影响力论文；Manifesting Pipeline成功重建顶级期刊文章核心概念（85%案例可靠）；Spacer输出与领先论文相似度显著高于SOTA LLM。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过创新的去情境化方法，能够自主生成具有创造性和事实基础的原创科学概念，在科学发现自动化方面展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管语言模型被训练来模仿人类，但它们展现出超越任何个体的能力。研究旨在理解这一现象，识别训练数据中导致模型超越数据源性能的关键属性。

Method: 引入基于知识图谱的模拟环境，让模拟专家根据各自专业知识生成数据。通过控制数据多样性来研究模型超越能力的形成机制。

Result: 研究发现数据多样性的多个方面有助于实现模型的超越能力，包括技能去噪、技能选择和技能泛化三种超越模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个受控的实验环境，有助于未来在该领域的进一步研究，揭示了数据多样性在模型能力超越中的重要作用。

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

TL;DR: AgentRAN是一个基于AI的Open RAN框架，使用自然语言意图驱动的分布式AI代理来动态管理和优化蜂窝网络，取代传统的静态控制和手动操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Open RAN部署仍然依赖静态控制和手动操作，无法满足动态网络需求。需要一种能够自动解释自然语言意图、自适应优化的智能网络控制系统。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的AI代理解释自然语言意图，通过结构化对话协商策略，在时间尺度、空间域和协议层上分解复杂意图，并建立自组织代理层次结构。AI-RAN工厂自动化生成嵌入改进控制算法的新代理。

Result: 在5G测试床上通过级联意图动态平衡竞争用户需求的实时实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: AgentRAN通过自然语言协调取代刚性API，从根本上重新定义了未来6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

TL;DR: 将纯过去STL(安全/危险)监控降为追踪检查，并使用GPU加速和遗传算法实现早期故障检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控技术需要构建双指数复杂度的自动机，限制了实际应用性，需要更高效的监控方法

Method: 将纯过去STL安全/危险子集的监控问题转换为追踪检查问题，利用GPU并行计算优化，通过遗传算法从历史数据中学习时序属性

Result: 实现了时间复杂度为公式大小和追踪长度多项式的高效监控，在关键性能指标上比现有最佳方法提升2-10%

Conclusion: 通过监控问题的转换和GPU加速，实现了高效的可解释早期故障检测，为实时验证提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在视频游戏中有广泛应用潜力，但其可信度尚未充分探索。研究发现LLM固有的社会偏见会直接损害现实游戏环境中的游戏平衡。

Method: 提出FairGamer基准测试，包含6个任务和新指标D_lstd，涵盖三个关键游戏场景：NPC服务、竞争对手交互和游戏场景生成，使用现实基础和完全虚构的游戏内容。

Result: 实验发现：(1)决策偏见直接导致游戏平衡恶化，Grok-3表现最差(D_lstd=0.431)；(2)LLM对现实和虚拟内容表现出同构的社会/文化偏见，表明偏见源于模型固有特性。

Conclusion: 这些发现暴露了LLM在游戏应用中存在的关键可靠性差距，需要进一步解决模型偏见问题以确保游戏公平性。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑约束任务中的不足，同时避免LRM的高计算成本和慢推理速度，通过结合两者的优势来提升推理效率

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构推广为SOFAI-LM，使用元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供针对性迭代反馈和相关示例，必要时调用LRM

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务中显著提升LLM的问题解决能力，在保持低推理时间的同时达到或超越独立LRM的准确率

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM通过反馈驱动的方法有效协调快慢AI模型，为复杂推理任务提供了高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有的基于LLM的方法

Conclusion: LLM-NAR框架能够有效提升LLM在多智能体路径规划任务中的性能，且易于适配到不同的LLM模型

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,

of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests

uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型评估存在模态比较困难，因为任务差异和信息不对称会混淆结果。需要一种能够严格比较文本符号推理和视觉空间推理能力的方法。

Method: 引入SEAM基准，使用四种领域（如数学、化学等）的标准化文本和视觉符号系统，创建语义等价但模态不同的输入对，避免OCR式的图像文本配对问题。

Result: 测试21个当代模型发现系统性模态不平衡：视觉性能普遍落后于语言性能，跨模态一致性较低。主要错误源于文本感知失败（分词问题）和视觉感知失败（幻觉）。

Conclusion: SEAM为测量和改进模态无关推理提供了一个受控的语义等价环境，揭示了VLMs在跨模态一致性方面的系统性挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

TL;DR: ST-Raptor是一个基于树结构的框架，用于处理半结构化表格的问答任务，通过分层正交树和树操作管道来解决复杂表格布局的理解问题，在SSTQA数据集上比基线方法准确率提升20%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半结构化表格（如财务报表、医疗记录）在现实应用中广泛使用，但现有方法（如NL2SQL、NL2Code）在转换过程中会造成信息损失，且难以理解复杂布局，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出分层正交树（HO-Tree）结构模型捕捉复杂表格布局，定义基本树操作指导LLM执行问答任务，通过问题分解、操作管道生成和对齐，并采用前向和后向两阶段验证机制。

Result: 在包含102个真实半结构化表格和764个问题的SSTQA数据集上，ST-Raptor比9个基线方法准确率最高提升20%。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor通过树结构建模和操作管道有效解决了半结构化表格的复杂布局理解问题，为自动化表格问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Result: 研究发现LLM虽然不像特定生物系统那样具有严格的焦点化专业化，但表现出独特的模块社区，其涌现的技能模式部分反映了生物认知系统中分布式但相互连接的组织结构。数值结果显示LLM技能获取显著受益于动态的跨区域交互和神经可塑性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM可解释性提供了新见解，表明有效的微调策略应利用分布式学习动态而非刚性模块化干预，整合认知科学与机器学习为理解基础模型开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多级分集编码方案，用于军事等关键任务场景中的超可靠低延迟通信，通过控制接收信息、提供不同优先级数据流的可靠性保证，并在网络路径增加时保持低复杂度设计。

Motivation: 解决军事应用中由于移动性、干扰或敌对攻击导致的持续不对称链路阻塞问题，确保延迟敏感传输的可靠性。

Method: 采用多级分集编码(MDC)方案，在三条边不相交路径上对两个优先级级别进行编码，证明叠加编码在一般情况下可实现容量区域，仅在特定情况下需要网络编码。

Result: 完整刻画了三路径两优先级级别的容量区域，确定了叠加编码方案在任意数量路径下实现容量的充分条件，并将MDC设计问题等效为组合网络中的编码设计问题。

Conclusion: 多级分集编码方案能够有效应对关键任务通信中的链路阻塞挑战，提供不同优先级的可靠性保障，同时保持设计的简洁性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communication is essential in mission-critical
settings, including military applications, where persistent and asymmetric link
blockages caused by mobility, jamming, or adversarial attacks can disrupt
delay-sensitive transmissions. This paper addresses this challenge by deploying
a multilevel diversity coding (MDC) scheme that controls the received
information, offers distinct reliability guarantees based on the priority of
data streams, and maintains low design and operational complexity as the number
of network paths increases. For two priority levels over three edge-disjoint
paths, the complete capacity region is characterized, showing that
superposition coding achieves the region in general, whereas network coding is
required only in a specific corner case. Moreover, sufficient conditions under
which a simple superposition coding scheme achieves the capacity for an
arbitrary number of paths are identified. To prove these results and provide a
unified analytical framework, the problem of designing high-performing MDC
schemes is shown to be equivalent to the problem of designing high-performing
encoding schemes over a class of broadcast networks, referred to as combination
networks in the literature.

Abstract: A polarization-aware direction-of-arrival (DoA) detection scheme is conceived
that leverages the intrinsic vector sensitivity of a single Rydberg atomic
vapor cell to achieve quantum-enhanced angle resolution. Our core idea lies in
the fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely
determined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of
which can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be
specific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable
quantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the
same vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted
from the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole
transition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same
experimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole
resonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF
magnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent
sensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the
need for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation,
we derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization
and orientation angles. Finally, simulation results spanning various quantum
parameters validate the proposed approach and identify optimal operating
regimes. With appropriately chosen polarization and magnetic-field geometries,
a single vapor cell is expected to achieve sub-0.1$^\circ$ angle resolution at
moderate RF-field driving strengths.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework for distributed inference, semantic
communication, and exploration in spatial networks by integrating stochastic
geometry with information geometry - a direction that has not been explored in
prior literature. Specifically, we study the problem of estimating and
aggregating a field of Gaussian distributions indexed by a spatial Poisson
point process (PPP), under both the Fisher--Rao and 2-Wasserstein geometries.
We derive non-asymptotic concentration bounds and Palm deviations for the
empirical Fr\'echet mean, thereby quantifying the geometric uncertainty induced
by spatial randomness. Building on these results, we demonstrate applications
to wireless sensor networks, where our framework provides geometry-aware
aggregation methods that downweight unreliable sensors and rigorously
characterize estimation error under random deployment. Further, we extend our
theory to semantic communications, proposing compression protocols that
guarantee semantic fidelity via distortion bounds on Fr\'echet means under PPP
sampling. Finally, we introduce the \texttt{Fr\'echet-UCB} algorithm for
multi-armed bandit problems with heteroscedastic Gaussian rewards. This
algorithm combines upper confidence bounds with a geometry-aware penalty
reflecting deviation from the evolving Fr\'echet mean, and we derive regret
bounds that exploit geometric structure. Simulations validate the theoretical
predictions across wireless sensor networks, semantic compression tasks, and
bandit environments, highlighting scalability, robustness, and improved
decision-making. Our results provide a principled mathematical foundation for
geometry-aware inference, semantic communication, and exploration in
distributed systems with statistical heterogeneity.

Furthermore, we give constructions utilizing the real numbers by first encoding

benefits of the schemes over the complex numbers, including good numerical
stability, but are computationally more efficient. To analyze the numerical
stability and the mutual information leakage, we give some bounds on the
condition numbers of Vandermonde matrices whose evaluation points are roots of
unity.

Abstract: Acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI) introduces substantial
challenges in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems, primarily due to the
large dimensionality of channel parameters, especially under ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (uRLLC) constraints. Furthermore, the impact of
imperfect CSI on the average achievable rate within the finite blocklength
regime remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, this paper proposes a
novel analytical framework that provides a closed-form expression for the
average achievable rate with imperfect CSI in the Laplace domain. We
demonstrate analytically that both the channel dispersion and the expected
channel capacity can be expressed explicitly in terms of the Laplace transform
of the large-scale fading component. Numerical simulations confirm that the
derived expressions match closely with Monte Carlo simulations, verifying their
accuracy. Furthermore, we theoretically show that although imperfect CSI
degrades performance in the finite blocklength regime, the inherent
characteristics of CF-mMIMO architecture effectively mitigates this loss.

Abstract: A pilot-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated, in which phase-modulated continuous wave (PMCW) and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) waveforms are co-designed to achieve
simultaneous target sensing and data transmission. To enhance effective data
throughput (i.e., Goodput) in PMCW-NOMA ISAC systems, we propose a deep
learning-based receiver architecture, termed two-timescale Transformer
(T3former), which leverages a Transformer architecture to perform joint channel
estimation and multi-user signal detection without the need for dedicated pilot
signals. By treating the deterministic structure of the PMCW waveform as an
implicit pilot, the proposed T3former eliminates the overhead associated with
traditional pilot-based methods. The proposed T3former processes the received
PMCW-NOMA signals on two distinct timescales, where a fine-grained attention
mechanism captures local features across the fast-time dimension, while a
coarse-grained mechanism aggregates global spatio-temporal dependencies of the
slow-time dimension. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed T3former
significantly outperforms traditional successive interference cancellation
(SIC) receivers, which avoids inherent error propagation in SIC. Specifically,
the proposed T3former achieves a substantially lower bit error rate and a
higher Goodput, approaching the theoretical maximum capacity of a pilot-free
system.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of
next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates
and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing
communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing
safety remains largely under-explored. In this paper, the possibility of
spoofing the sensing function of ISAC in vehicle networks is examined, whereby
a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise
the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). For this scenario, the
requirements on the malicious RIS' phase shifts design and number of reflecting
elements are analyzed. Under such spoofing, the practical estimation bias of
the vehicular user (VU)'s Doppler shift and angle-of-departure (AoD) for an
arbitrary time slot is analytically derived. Moreover, from the attacker's
view, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to optimize the RIS' phase
shifts design. The goal of this MDP is to generate complete and plausible fake
trajectories by incorporating the concept of spatial-temporal consistency. To
defend against this sensing spoofing attack, a signal temporal logic
(STL)-based neuro-symbolic attack detection framework is proposed and shown to
learn interoperable formulas for identifying spoofed trajectories.
