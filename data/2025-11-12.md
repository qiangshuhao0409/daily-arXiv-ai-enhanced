TL;DR: 提出了DGET框架，结合图神经网络和Transformer来解决混合RF-OWC物联网网络中的双技术调度问题，在部分信道可观测条件下实现近最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合物联网网络中RF和OWC双技术调度的NP难问题，克服传统优化方法在大规模场景下的计算复杂性和完全信道可观测的不切实际假设。

Method: 采用监督多任务学习架构，包含两阶段图神经网络（转导式GNN编码拓扑和初始状态，归纳式GNN进行时序精炼）和基于Transformer的编码器，通过一致性损失和分类损失进行训练。

Result: 混合RF-OWC网络比纯RF系统能更高效处理高流量负载，信息年龄降低达20%，能耗相当。DGET框架相比传统优化方法实现超过90%分类准确率，计算复杂度降低，在部分信道可观测下更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DGET框架有效解决了混合物联网网络中的双技术调度问题，在保持近最优性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dual-technology scheduling in hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) networks that integrate Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) alongside Radio Frequency (RF). We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络需要内在智能来支持新兴应用，如扩展现实和自主系统，满足超高可靠性和低延迟要求。捏合天线作为新型灵活低成本技术，可以按需创建视距链路。

Method: 利用人工智能管理PA激活位置和资源分配的复杂控制，同时PA支持联邦学习和空中聚合等边缘AI任务。

Result: AI与PA形成"双赢"合作：AI促进PA激活位置的自适应优化，PA支持边缘AI任务执行。

Conclusion: 这种协同作用为自适应、弹性和自优化的下一代网络铺平道路，并讨论了包括大语言模型驱动的PA控制框架、语义通信和集成感知通信等有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Next-generation (NG) wireless networks must embrace innate intelligence in support of demanding emerging applications, such as extended reality and autonomous systems, under ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the "win-win" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks.

Abstract: The emerging edge-hub-cloud paradigm has enabled the development of innovative latency-critical cyber-physical applications in the edge-cloud continuum. However, this paradigm poses multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the devices at the edge of the network, their limited computational, communication, and energy capacities, as well as their different sensing and actuating capabilities. To address these issues, we propose an optimal scheduling approach to minimize the overall latency of a workflow application in an edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical system. We consider multiple edge devices cooperating with a hub device and a cloud server. All devices feature heterogeneous multicore processors and various sensing, actuating, or other specialized capabilities. We present a comprehensive formulation based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming, encapsulating multiple constraints often overlooked by existing approaches. We conduct a comparative experimental evaluation between our method and a well-established and effective scheduling heuristic, which we enhanced to consider the constraints of the specific problem. The results reveal that our technique outperforms the heuristic, achieving an average latency improvement of 13.54% in a relevant real-world use case, under varied system configurations. In addition, the results demonstrate the scalability of our method under synthetic workflows of varying sizes, attaining a 33.03% average latency decrease compared to the heuristic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF指纹数据集设备规模小且型号混杂，难以进行稳健训练和公平评估，特别是区分同型号设备的微小硬件差异具有挑战性

Method: 构建包含123个相同商业IEEE 802.11g设备的大规模数据集，收集3542万原始I/Q样本并提取185万RF特征，开发完全可复现的开源实验框架，提出基于随机森林的识别算法

Conclusion: 该大规模同型号设备数据集和开源框架为RF指纹识别研究提供了重要基础，证明了在同型号设备间区分微小硬件差异的可行性

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting exploits hardware imperfections for device identification, but distinguishing between same-model devices remains challenging due to their minimal hardware variations. Existing datasets for RF fingerprinting are constrained by small device scales and heterogeneous models, which hinders robust training and fair evaluation for machine learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of same-model devices along with a fully reproducible, open-source experimental framework. The dataset is built using 123 identical commercial IEEE 802.11g devices and contains 35.42 million raw I/Q samples from the preambles and corresponding 1.85 million RF features. The open-source framework further ensures full reproducibility from data collection to final evaluation. Within this framework, a Random Forest-based algorithm is proposed to achieve 89.06% identification accuracy on this dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations further confirm the relationships between the extracted features.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Procurator是一个验证框架，用于高效捕获分布式网络内程序的交互行为，通过结合actor范式和CSP模型，统一意图语言和语义感知状态剪枝来确保系统可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式网络内程序在数据中心部署日益增多，但将应用逻辑转移到交换机也扩大了故障域。现有验证框架忽略了分布式环境中的常见交互行为，导致可能引发状态不一致和系统故障的相关bug被遗漏。

Method: 引入结合actor范式和CSP的形式化模型，将流水线执行转换为反应式、事件驱动的actor，并通过消息传递统一它们的交互。提供统一的意图语言来灵活指定分布式属性，并采用语义感知状态剪枝器来降低验证复杂度。

Result: 在五个真实世界的网络内系统中高效发现了10个由交互行为引起的不同bug，与最先进的验证器相比，验证时间最多减少913.2倍，内存消耗最多减少1.9倍。

Conclusion: Procurator能够有效捕获分布式网络内程序中的交互行为，显著提高验证效率和系统可靠性，为分布式网络内程序的正确性验证提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed in-network programs are increasingly deployed in data centers for their performance benefits, but shifting application logic to switches also enlarges the failure domain. Ensuring their correctness before deployment is thus critical for reliability. While prior verification frameworks can efficiently detect bugs for programs running on a single switch, they overlook the common interactive behaviors in distributed settings, thereby missing related bugs that can cause state inconsistencies and system failures. This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems. It also reduces verification time by up to 913.2x and memory consumption by up to 1.9x compared to the state-of-the-art verifier.

### [6] [SRE-Llama -- Fine-Tuned Meta's Llama LLM, Federated Learning, Blockchain and NFT Enabled Site Reliability Engineering(SRE) Platform for Communication and Networking Software Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08282)

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了SRE-Llama平台，结合生成式AI、联邦学习、区块链和NFT技术，自动化云原生环境中的SRE监控、SLI/SLO生成和告警管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开发者对Prometheus、Grafana等监控工具以及SLI/SLO定义缺乏深入理解的问题，简化SRE流程。

Method: 通过联邦学习识别关键SLI指标，使用微调的Llama-3 LLM智能生成SLI/SLO和告警机制，将生成的SLI/SLO编码为NFT存储在区块链上，利用智能合约实现自动化管理。

Result: 开发了SRE-Llama平台原型，并在定制的Open5GS 5G核心网络上进行了用例验证。

Conclusion: 该平台通过AI和区块链技术有效解决了SRE流程的复杂性问题，提供了自动化的监控和指标管理解决方案。

Abstract: Software services are crucial for reliable communication and networking; therefore, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is important to ensure these systems stay reliable and perform well in cloud-native environments. SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文旨在以完整且易于理解的方式介绍QUIC协议，帮助读者克服学习QUIC时遇到的困难，包括协议快速演进、RFC文档复杂性和跨层实现特性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QUIC作为推动HTTP/3的先进传输层协议，在互联网上已广泛应用。但读者学习QUIC面临三大困难：协议快速演进（标准QUIC与已弃用的Google QUIC区分）、RFC文档组织复杂难以理解，以及QUIC的跨层和隐私中心实现特性使得仅通过数据包无法理解或调试。

Method: 通过系统性地解析QUIC协议规范，以完整且易于理解的方式呈现QUIC协议，包括其状态管理、连接导向特性以及与TCP+TLS组合的对比。

Result: 论文提供了对QUIC协议的全面解析，帮助读者理解其工作原理、特性优势以及在实际应用中的表现。

Conclusion: 本文成功地为读者提供了理解QUIC协议的清晰路径，消除了从规范文档学习时的困惑，使这一复杂的跨层协议变得易于理解和掌握。

Abstract: QUIC is an advanced transport layer protocol whose ubiquity on the Internet is now very apparent. Importantly, QUIC fuels the next generation of web browsing: HTTP/3. QUIC is a stateful and connection oriented protocol which offers similar features (and more) to the combination of TCP and TLS. There are several difficulties which readers may encounter when learning about QUIC: i.) its rapid evolution (particularly, differentiation between the QUIC standard and the now deprecated Google QUIC), ii.) numerous RFCs whose organization, language, and detail may be challenging to the casual reader, and iii.) the nature of QUIC's cross-layer and privacy-centric implementation, making it impossible to understand or debug by looking at packets alone. For these reasons, the aim of this paper is to present QUIC in a complete yet approachable fashion, thereby demystifying the protocol from its specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基站解耦为离散RAN功能引入了新威胁，一个RAN功能故障可能触发级联故障，影响整个功能链，导致网络性能下降和中断。

Conclusion: 提出的弹性机制能有效缓解级联故障影响，通过自适应功能部署显著提升网络性能恢复能力。

Abstract: The disaggregation of base stations into discrete RAN functions introduces new threats to mobile networks, as failures in one RAN function can trigger cascading failures and disrupt the entire functional chain, impacting network performance and leading to outages. In this paper, we propose the first resilience mechanism leveraging the adaptive placement of RAN functions to mitigate disruptions and recover service continuity in the presence of compromised infrastructure. Our model detects disrupted RUs due to cascading failures, reacts by re-instantiating CU and DU in alternative cloud locations, and recovers service continuity by reestablishing functional chains. We formulate this recovery process as an optimization problem that maximizes post-failure network performance while considering computational and communication constraints of the infrastructure. We numerically evaluated our approach on a real-world mobile network topology under multiple failure scenarios, and demonstrated that our solution recovers up to 70% higher throughput compared to conventional resilience mechanisms.

### [10] [Analysing Environmental Efficiency in AI for X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436)
*Liam Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较了14种AI模型在COVID-19胸部X光检测中的表现，发现小型判别模型在准确性和环境影响方面优于大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI工具在医疗诊断中的集成效率，特别关注大型语言模型与小型判别模型在COVID-19检测中的表现对比，以及它们的环境影响。

Method: 将LLMs和小型判别模型集成到Mendix应用中，使用14种不同模型配置进行COVID-19胸部X光检测，比较准确性和碳足迹。

Result: 小型模型减少碳足迹但输出偏向阳性诊断且置信度不足；限制LLMs仅输出概率导致性能下降；Covid-Net模型表现最佳，准确率95.5%，碳足迹比GPT-4.5-Preview减少99.9%。

Conclusion: 生成式模型不适合分类任务，小型判别模型在准确性和环境影响方面更优，使用生成式工具进行分类存在环境风险。

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的奖励模型C2RM，用于增强STEM推理能力，通过惩罚低置信度的正确答案来促进更稳健和逻辑一致的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的奖励强化学习在小规模基础模型上经常产生低质量推理链或推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题，限制了资源有限组织在小规模模型上直接进行强化学习训练。

Result: 该方法在多个STEM基准测试中优于几个最先进的开源奖励模型，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的C2RM方法能够有效提升小规模模型的STEM推理能力，为资源有限的组织提供了可行的强化学习训练方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

### [13] [Procedural Knowledge Improves Agentic LLM Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07568)
*Vincent Hsiao,Mark Roberts,Leslie Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用分层任务网络（HTN）作为程序性知识可以显著提升LLM在代理任务中的表现，甚至能让较小的模型超越更大的基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代理任务中表现不佳，需要大量工具支持、提示工程或微调。程序性知识被证明能提高规划效率，但很少研究评估其在需要隐式规划的代理任务中对LLM性能的潜在提升。

Method: 形式化、实现并评估了一个利用分层任务网络（HTN）作为程序性知识的代理LLM工作流程，包括手工编码HTN和LLM生成的HTN。

Result: 手工编码HTN能显著提升LLM在代理任务中的性能，使用HTN能让20b或70b参数的LLM超越120b参数的基准模型。LLM生成的HTN也能提升性能，但效果较弱。

Conclusion: 利用来自人类、文档或LLM的专业知识来策划程序性知识将成为改进LLM工作流程的另一个重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

TL;DR: Orion训练框架使紧凑模型(350M-1.2B参数)能够通过学习的搜索策略执行迭代检索，在多个基准测试中优于大200-400倍的检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法存在缺陷：神经检索器缺乏推理能力，LLM成本过高，查询重写或分解仅限于静态转换，无法捕捉复杂查询所需的迭代探索、反馈和修订动态。

Method: Orion结合：(1)合成轨迹生成和监督微调以鼓励多样化探索模式；(2)强化学习奖励有效查询优化和回溯行为；(3)推理时束搜索算法利用RL期间学习的自反能力。

Result: 1.2B模型在SciFact上达到77.6%成功率(先前72.6%)，BRIGHT上25.2%(先前22.1%)，NFCorpus上63.2%(先前57.8%)，在FEVER、HotpotQA和MSMarco上保持竞争力，在六个基准中的五个上优于大200-400倍的检索器。

Conclusion: 检索性能可以从学习策略中涌现，而不仅仅是模型规模，当模型被训练去搜索、反思和修订时。

Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Chenda Duan,David Chong,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Semantic Workspace (GSW)框架，解决LLMs在长上下文推理中的挑战，通过构建结构化、可解释的情境表示来跟踪实体在事件中的演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要针对基于事实的检索，无法构建时空锚定的叙事表示来跟踪实体在事件中的演化过程。

Method: GSW框架包含Operator和Reconciler两个组件：Operator将观察映射到中间语义结构，Reconciler将这些结构整合到持久工作空间中，确保时间、空间和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench)上，GSW比现有RAG基线性能提升高达20%，查询时上下文token减少51%，显著降低推理时间成本。

Conclusion: GSW为LLMs提供了类人情景记忆的具体蓝图，为能够在长视野上进行推理的更强大智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Motivation: 团队中个体贡献的公平评估存在挑战，冲突和工作量差异导致不公平绩效评估，需要成本高昂的人工干预

Method: 构建三维度九基准框架（贡献、互动、角色），整合异构数据，使用客观指标和基尼系数识别冲突，采用LLM架构进行验证和情境分析

Conclusion: 提出了实用的分析方法和偏见防护措施，同时指出了局限性和实际挑战

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在可验证领域表现出色，但在具有不确定结果的高风险战略决策中可靠性不足，这源于人类和AI系统中相互强化的认知偏见，威胁投资决策的可辩护性和可持续性。

Method: 通过对7个前沿级LLM和3个面向市场的风险投资案例进行系统定性评估，开发了包含7阶段校准序列、4阶段初始化过程和5层保护架构的框架，实现偏见自我监控、人机对抗挑战、伙伴状态验证等功能。

Result: 研究发现：通过有序校准可实现伙伴状态但需要紧急维护协议；当架构漂移和上下文耗尽同时发生时可靠性会下降；解散纪律可避免追求根本错误方向。跨模型验证显示不同LLM架构存在系统性性能差异。

Conclusion: 人类-AI团队能够实现认知伙伴关系，在高风险决策中预防可避免的遗憾，满足依赖AI系统支持关键决策而不引入可预防认知陷阱的投资回报期望。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

Motivation: 开发能够利用非结构化数据进行大规模专家级预测的AI系统，填补现有LLM在判断性预测方面的性能差距。

Method: 结合三个核心要素：1）对高质量新闻源的智能搜索；2）监督代理协调同一事件的不同预测；3）统计校准技术对抗LLM的行为偏见。

Conclusion: 建立了AI预测的新技术标准，提供了实用的可转移研究建议，首次实现可验证的大规模专家级预测。

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

Motivation: 深度研究代理需要处理开放式查询，但现有评估方法难以应对长篇幅、多样化的响应，以及依赖动态信息源的问题。

Method: 构建ResearchRubrics基准，包含真实多样的提示和精细评分标准；提出基于概念广度、逻辑嵌套和探索的三维复杂度框架；开发人工和模型评估协议。

Result: 评估多个最先进的DR系统，发现即使是领先的代理如Gemini DR和OpenAI DR，在评分标准符合度上平均低于68%，主要问题是遗漏隐含上下文和对检索信息推理不足。

Conclusion: 需要强大可扩展的深度研究能力评估方法，发布ResearchRubrics基准以促进研究助手的发展。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够生成连贯、细致的文档，并动态适应变化条件，推动了军事训练场景生成的自动化进程。

Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

Abstract: Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.

TL;DR: 提出Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ)方法，在量化过程中通过对比学习保持模型的安全对齐性，解决传统量化方法只关注困惑度而忽视安全性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化(PTQ)方法只追求低困惑度，但量化可能导致模型安全对齐性显著下降，困惑度不能充分代表模型安全性。

Method: 在PTQ流程中集成Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC)损失，鼓励量化模型模仿安全指令调优模型，同时偏离未对齐的预训练模型。

Result: AAQ方法实现了稳健的4位(W4A4)量化，在LLaMA、Qwen和Mistral等模型家族中保持安全性，而先前方法在此方面失败。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了效率与安全性之间的关键权衡，为实现既高效又可信赖的大语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy. Anonymized code is available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: GAMA通过图感知多模态注意力机制有效解决了VRP问题，证明了多模态表示和门控融合在提升神经邻域搜索性能方面的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

Motivation: 现有基于logit的水印方法在随机分割词汇表时可能排除最高概率的词汇，从而影响生成流畅性。需要一种既能满足监管要求（如欧盟AI法案）又能保持生成质量的水印方法。

Method: 首先按模型概率降序排列词汇表，然后通过模k运算对排名进行分区，将语义相似的相邻词汇分配到不同类别。在零比特设置中，使用熵自适应门选择奇偶类；在多比特设置中，根据当前有效载荷数字选择对应的模k类别。

Conclusion: WaterMod通过概率感知的模块化规则，实现了在保持生成质量的同时嵌入可检测水印，为AI生成内容的溯源提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

Conclusion: 置信度感知的神经解码可以为实际脑机接口通信系统提供稳健的部署导向行为。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

Conclusion: 结果表明基于EEG的辅助系统在失语症患者现实世界的不完美言语条件下具有可行性。

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型训练依赖大规模偏好标注和昂贵的LLM微调，在资源有限条件下难以获得可靠的奖励模型。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，提取偏好相关的可解释方向，通过投影计算对齐分数，最后用简单奖励头聚合分数预测偏好得分。

Result: 在三个偏好建模任务上，SparseRM优于大多数主流奖励模型，同时使用的可训练参数少于1%。

Conclusion: SparseRM为高效对齐提供了有前景的解决方案，能够无缝集成到下游对齐流程中。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过语言解释数据的深度学习方法，利用大语言模型生成文本描述，结合影响力估计和CLIP评分选择最信息丰富的描述，并通过跨模态迁移分类验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型行为仍被视为黑盒，现有XAI方法主要关注模型预测解释，而本研究希望从数据角度理解深度学习模型训练过程，通过人类易于理解的语言媒介来解释数据。

Method: 构建生成文本描述的流程：1) 利用大语言模型结合外部知识库生成数据描述；2) 使用影响力估计和CLIP评分筛选最相关的文本描述；3) 提出跨模态迁移分类任务验证文本描述效果。

Result: 在零样本设置下，生成的文本描述比其他基线描述更有效，在九个图像分类数据集上显著提升了仅使用图像训练的模型性能，GPT-4o评估进一步证实了这些结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提供对模型决策过程内在可解释性的洞察，证明了通过语言解释数据的有效性，为理解深度学习模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Motivation: 现有负采样策略存在假阴性风险、泛化能力有限和样本难度控制不足等问题，需要开发更有效的负采样方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：难度评估模块（整合语义和结构特征）、自适应负采样模块（使用条件扩散模型生成不同难度负样本）、动态训练机制（动态调整样本难度分布）。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，DANS-KGC在UMLS和YAGO3-10数据集的所有三个评估指标上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DANS-KGC通过扩散模型和自适应采样策略，有效克服了传统负采样的局限性，在知识图谱补全任务中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过脑电图和卡片分类任务探索人类适应性推理的神经机制，发现delta-theta-alpha振荡协调参与规则推断和注意力稳定，而多模态大语言模型仅能进行短期反馈调整，缺乏真正的适应性推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应性推理使人类能够在环境规则或情境变化时灵活调整推理策略，但其潜在的神经动力学机制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用卡片分类范式结合脑电图技术，比较人类表现与多模态大语言模型的性能，进行刺激锁定和反馈锁定的神经活动分析。

Result: 发现协调的delta-theta-alpha动态：早期delta-theta活动反映探索性监测和规则推断，而枕叶alpha参与表明成功规则识别后的注意力确认稳定。多模态大语言模型仅表现出短期反馈驱动调整，缺乏层次规则抽象或真正的适应性推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现识别了人类适应性推理的神经特征，并强调了需要将振荡反馈协调纳入脑启发人工智能，以实现真正的上下文敏感适应。

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: A diffusion-based neural decoding framework optimized for real-time imagined speech classification in individuals with aphasia. The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing. The proposed framework advances the translation of imagined speech brain-computer interfaces toward clinical communication support for individuals with severe expressive language impairment.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法主要使用端到端强化学习训练LLMs利用外部检索器解决复杂问题，但缺乏对推理过程的监督，难以保证逻辑连贯性和严谨性。

Method: 提出分层思维模型Thinker，将复杂问题分解为子问题，每个子问题用自然语言和等效逻辑函数双重表示，通过逻辑函数传递依赖关系，并进行知识边界确定以避免不必要的外部搜索。

Conclusion: Thinker通过使推理过程可监督和可验证，有效提升了LLMs在复杂问题解决中的逻辑连贯性和性能。

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列生成的关键挑战在于建模时间动态的内在随机性，而现有扩散模型计算效率低，传统流匹配方法无法显式捕捉随机性。SDE天然适合建模随机性和不确定性。

Method: 采用基于SDE的流匹配框架，结合编码器架构，设计分量分解的速度场来捕捉时间序列的多方面结构，并通过额外的随机项增强表示表达能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该模型在生成质量、多样性和效率方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: TimeFlow是一个灵活通用的框架，支持无条件和条件生成任务，能够高效生成高质量的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决深度学习心电图诊断方法面临的两个主要障碍：处理不同配置心电信号的通用性不足，以及由于样本不平衡导致的风险信号检测不足。

Method: 使用基于图的表示方法统一建模异构心电信号，将心电信号转换为多功能图结构，结合去噪重建和对比学习来保留原始信息并突出病理模式。

Conclusion: VARS有望成为全面心脏健康评估的宝贵工具，能够精确定位异常心电模式并协助临床医生做出明智决策。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

Conclusion: 该框架能够提供更细粒度的解释，有效识别导致模型误分类的关键特征，为理解模型决策提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

Conclusion: ST-SAM完全依赖自注意力机制捕获局部和全局时空相关性，使其既有效又高效，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

Result: 理论分析表明PN-GNN不仅比C-GNN具有严格更强的表达能力，且其(k+1)跳逻辑表达能力严格优于k跳。在6个合成数据集和2个真实数据集上的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PN-GNN在不损害泛化能力的前提下增强了逻辑规则的表达能力，在知识图谱推理任务中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型语义推理和图神经网络结构建模的多视图多标签特征选择方法，通过语义图和统计图的双层异构图表示特征、视图和标签间的关系，使用轻量级图注意力网络学习特征重要性得分。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否真正具备数学理解能力，评估其在复杂环境中的推理能力，揭示当前LLMs在推理能力方面的缺陷和局限性。

Method: 提出新的扰动框架，包括注入语义无关的扰动句子、逐步增加扰动强度，以及核心提问指令缺失的额外扰动方法，详细分析LLMs的问题解决机制。

Result: LLMs面对无数字扰动句子时表现稳定但存在鲁棒性边界；面对有数字扰动句子时性能显著下降，开源模型下降近10%以上，最大下降达51.55%；最先进商业LLMs也有3%-10%性能下降；核心指令缺失时仍能保持20%-40%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs对数值信息扰动更敏感，容易在无关数值信息干扰下给出错误答案；可能依赖记忆模板或模式匹配而非逻辑推理；揭示了当前LLMs推理能力的缺陷，对LLMs进一步发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

Conclusion: 将结构化知识与先进推理策略相结合，能够实现可靠且可解释的生物分子推理。

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

Motivation: 企业采用AI代理系统需要可靠的评估方法，但传统LLM基准存在训练数据污染问题，且无法衡量代理能力（如多步工具使用、不确定性决策）。

Method: 开发了Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1基准，处理了170,000个LLM测试项，超过55亿个token，涵盖35种模型配置。

Result: 传统基准排名无法预测实际代理性能；新一代模型（如Llama 4、Qwen 3）在企业相关任务中不一定优于旧版本；提供了成本性能权衡、模型特定行为模式和推理能力对token效率影响的见解。

Conclusion: KAMI v0.1为企业部署决策提供了关键见解，强调了需要专门的企业级代理评估基准，而非依赖传统LLM基准。

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、语义保持和成本方面存在局限，需要系统研究LLMs在数学推理任务中对输入扰动的鲁棒性

Method: 结合嵌入空间余弦相似度、WordNet词典和掩码语言模型上下文预测三种信息源，为输入问题中的每个单词生成语义相似候选词，进行过滤和替换攻击

Result: 仅单个单词的轻微扰动就能使所有模型准确率显著下降（GSM8K最大下降49.89%，MATH500最大下降35.40%），同时保持高语义一致性，且平均响应长度大幅增加

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务中存在鲁棒性缺陷和效率瓶颈，轻微扰动会导致错误输出和更高计算资源消耗

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Result: 在六个任务系列中，基于检索的基础配置实现了更高的基础准确性（0.90），幻觉和解释漂移减少了约40%，透明度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 现有审慎原则已经能够容纳可靠的AI，前提是治理明确、数据可追溯且保证可验证，这些机制降低了风险转移和资本分配中的信息摩擦。

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

Conclusion: 这项工作为因果推理提供了新的算法工具包，首次在PCH框架中识别出了可处理性的途径。

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

Conclusion: 原则性数据筛选和鲁棒适配可以媲美大规模训练，能够构建紧凑但能力强的多模态推理智能体。

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实践上都证明了其有效性，能够保护用户数据不被未经授权的模型学习。

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Abstract: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning. Our results indicate that many structured EHR tasks place high demands on the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In response, we propose EHRMaster, a code-augmented method that achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers practical

Abstract: Hit identification is a central challenge in early drug discovery, traditionally requiring substantial experimental resources. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark of query-molecule pairs and docking scores for over three million compounds to contribute to the agentic future of drug design.

TL;DR: GAC是一种新的动作生成方法，通过将动作分解为方向向量和可学习浓度参数，在保持球形分布几何优势的同时简化计算，在连续控制任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯策略在连续控制中因无界支持而需要临时压缩函数的问题，以及vMF分布因依赖贝塞尔函数和拒绝采样而难以实际应用的问题。

Method: 将动作生成分解为方向向量和可学习浓度参数，实现确定性动作和均匀球形噪声之间的高效插值，参数数量从2d减少到d+1，计算复杂度从O(dk)降低到O(d)。

Result: 在6个MuJoCo基准测试中始终匹配或超越最先进方法，在Ant-v4上比SAC提升37.6%，在4/6任务中获得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 稳健高效的连续控制不需要复杂分布，而是需要对动作空间几何结构的原理性尊重。

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Motivation: 当前基于基础设施指标（如延迟、首令牌时间等）的评估方法无法捕捉AI智能体的决策质量、操作自主性或最终业务价值，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出11个跨领域的性能指标（如目标完成率、自主性指数等），并通过涉及4种不同智能体架构（ReAct、思维链、工具增强、混合）在5个领域（医疗、金融、营销、法律、客服）的大规模模拟实验来验证框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为AI智能体的整体评估提供了稳健、标准化的方法，为更有效的开发、部署和治理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

Conclusion: STV框架通过敏感性感知的任务向量插入，有效解决了多模态模型在多样本上下文学习中的挑战，提供了确定插入位置和内容的系统方法。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现工业数字自动化用例，将AI与大规模现实世界应用连接起来，展示了标签属性图在GraphRAG中的潜力。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

Motivation: LLMs越来越多地用作学习工具，但大多数工具仅限于文本，限制了在数学等可视化至关重要的领域的实用性。虽然LLMs能够生成编译为教育图形的代码，但主要瓶颈在于这些图形的可扩展评估。

Method: 提出DiagramIR评估管道，利用LaTeX TikZ代码的中间表示（IRs）进行自动和可扩展的几何图形评估。

Result: DiagramIR方法相比LLM-as-a-Judge等基线评估方法，与人类评分者的一致性更高。该评估方法使GPT-4.1-Mini等较小模型能够以10倍更低的推理成本达到GPT-5等较大模型的性能水平。

Conclusion: DiagramIR为部署可访问和可扩展的教育技术提供了重要支持，通过高效的自动评估方法解决了几何图形生成的可扩展评估瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

### [71] [SOM Directions are Better than One: Multi-Directional Refusal Suppression in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379)
*Giorgio Piras,Raffaele Mura,Fabio Brau,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用自组织映射(SOMs)从语言模型中提取多个拒绝方向的新方法，该方法优于现有的单方向拒绝编码方法，能更有效地抑制模型的安全拒绝行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将拒绝行为编码为潜在空间中的单一方向，但证据表明LLM中的概念通常以嵌入高维潜在空间的低维流形形式编码，因此需要探索多个拒绝方向。

Method: 使用自组织映射(SOMs)在有害提示表征上训练以识别多个神经元，通过从每个神经元减去无害表征的质心来推导表达拒绝概念的多个方向。

Result: 实验表明，从模型内部消融多个方向不仅优于单方向基线，也优于专门的越狱算法，能有效抑制拒绝行为。

Conclusion: 该方法在机制解释性方面具有重要意义，证明了拒绝概念在LLM中是以多方向形式编码的。

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了FaithEval评估框架和FaithAct规划执行框架，用于量化和提升多模态推理中的忠实性，将行为忠实性（推理与输出对齐）和感知忠实性（推理与输入对齐）区分开来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理过程中产生看似合理但缺乏依据的推理链的问题，这些推理链往往与感知证据或最终结论不符。

Method: 引入FaithEval通过评估每个声称的对象是否在图像中得到视觉支持来量化步骤级和链级忠实性；提出FaithAct框架，在每一步推理中强制实施证据基础。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，FaithAct将感知忠实性提升了高达26%，同时不降低任务准确性，相比基于提示和工具增强的基线方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 将忠实性作为指导原则不仅能够减轻幻觉问题，还能产生更稳定的推理轨迹，为多模态推理中的忠实性评估和执行建立了统一框架。

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LLM版本更新成本高、频率低且难以定制，导致已发布模型存在已知安全漏洞，需要一种轻量级、快速的修复机制。

Method: 在现有模型前添加紧凑的可学习前缀作为"补丁"，仅引入极少量额外参数，将模型行为引导至更安全的参考模型。

Result: 在毒性缓解、偏见减少和有害拒绝三个关键领域，安全补丁实现了与新一代安全对齐模型相当的安全改进，同时保持了流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM可以像软件一样打补丁，为供应商和从业者提供在大版本发布之间分发可扩展、高效和可组合安全更新的实用机制。

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越多地参与数学研究和教育，了解其判断与人类判断的对齐程度变得重要，特别是在数学问题的趣味性和难度评估方面。

Method: 通过两个实证研究，分别对众包平台参与者和国际数学奥林匹克竞赛选手进行调查，比较人类与多种LLMs对数学问题趣味性和难度的评估。

Result: LLMs在总体上能与人类对数学趣味性的判断达成一致，但无法准确反映人类判断的分布模式，且与人类选择的趣味性理由相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在捕捉人类对数学问题趣味性判断方面既有潜力也有局限性，适合作为数学AI思维合作伙伴，但需要进一步改进。

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Conclusion: 该方法在多个方面表现出显著优势，为速率解码和延迟解码提供了一个非常有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.

TL;DR: 提出基于群概率的Turbo乘积码解码方法，相比传统的比特概率解码，能更好地保留比特相关性，在内外相关性场景下分别获得0.3dB和0.7dB的信噪比增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Turbo乘积码解码在组件解码器之间传递对数似然比时，当存在比特相关性时会丢失信息。这种相关性可能来自外部源（如符号间干扰）或内部解码过程。

Method: 采用群概率解码方法，重新审视非二进制Turbo乘积码，利用符号级ORBGRAND与软输出GRAND（SOGRAND）相结合，部分保留比特相关性。

Result: 基于群概率的Turbo乘积码解码在内生相关性场景下获得0.3dB信噪比增益，在外生相关性场景下获得0.7dB信噪比增益。

Conclusion: 群概率解码方法能有效保留比特相关性，显著提升Turbo乘积码的解码性能，特别是在存在相关性的通信场景中。

Abstract: Binary turbo product codes (TPCs) are powerful error-correcting codes constructed from short component codes. Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology has emerged as a key enabler of intelligent transportation systems, while the Terahertz (THz) band offers abundant spectrum resources to support ultra-high-speed and low-latency V2X communications. This paper investigates the in-vehicle wireless channel in the 300~GHz band. First, channel measurement based on vector-network-analyzer (VNA) is conducted under typical V2X scenarios, including with/without human, and window-on/off cases. Then, a digital twin (DT) of the vehicle is constructed from high-resolution point cloud data and a measurement-based material property database. The DT is integrated into an open-source ray-tracing (RT) simulator, Sionna, to model multipath propagation. The DT-empowered simulation results are analyzed and validated with the measurement data, showing strong agreement and validating the feasibility. Finally, a hybrid ray-tracing-statistic channel model is established, combining the RT results and measurement data. Leveraging the validated model, further wireless planning is carried out, including signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) analysis, coverage probability evaluation, and optimal transmitter (Tx) placement. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and deployment of future THz in-vehicle communication systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a key challenge faced by joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in digital semantic communication (SemCom): the incompatibility between existing JSCC schemes that yield continuous encoded representations and digital systems that employ discrete variable-length codewords. It further results in feasibility issues in achieving physical bit-level rate control via such JSCC approaches for efficient semantic transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) offers low-cost and low-power connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT), where a backscatter tag (BT) modulates incident signals transmitted by an ambient radio frequency (RF) source and reflects them to its associated AmBC receiver. In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold.

Abstract: 6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.

Motivation: 现有LEO卫星网络分析缺乏考虑卫星间安全距离导致的局部排斥特性，需要开发能反映实际部署约束的理论模型。

Method: 将卫星空间位置建模为球面上的强球调节点过程，体现卫星间安全距离约束；推导Nakagami-m和瑞利衰落下的条件覆盖概率下界；与Starlink星座进行对比验证。

Result: 分析结果与Starlink星座经验模拟几乎完美匹配（仅1dB偏移），为实际值提供了紧密下界。

Conclusion: 该框架是LEO卫星网络的合适理论模型，具有低计算复杂度，支持高效数值评估。

Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework, developed based on the spatial network calculus, for performance assessment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. Specifically, we model the satellites' spatial positions as a strong ball-regulated point process on the sphere. Under this model, proximal points in space exhibit a locally repulsive property, reflecting the fact that intersatellite links are protected by a safety distance and would not be arbitrarily close. Subsequently, we derive analytical lower bounds on the conditional coverage probabilities under Nakagami-$m$ and Rayleigh fading, respectively. These expressions have a low computational complexity, enabling efficient numerical evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model by contrasting the coverage probability obtained from our analysis with that estimated from a Starlink constellation. The results show that our analysis provides a tight lower bound on the actual value and, surprisingly, matches the empirical simulations almost perfectly with a 1 dB shift. This demonstrates our framework as an appropriate theoretical model for LEO satellite networks.

Conclusion: 该研究为具有部分存储约束服务器的鲁棒动态编码分布式存储系统提供了完整的理论基础和性能极限分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of Robust Dynamic Coded Distributed Storage (RDCDS) with partially storage constrained servers where the goal is to enable robust (resilient to server dropouts) and efficient (as measured by the communication costs) read and update operations, subject to the constraint that the storage at $S$ out of $N$ servers is limited by $1/K_c$ the size of the message. Building upon previously established converse arguments and achievability schemes by Jia et al., in this work we develop a set of new converse arguments and coding designs that enable us to completely characterize the fundamental limits of RDCDS with partially storage constrained servers, i.e., the minimum number of available servers for feasible update operation and the minimum communication costs for read and update operations across various server dropout scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效地计算笛卡尔无平方码的广义汉明权重，并且结果可以推广到射影空间上的求值码。

Abstract: The generalized Hamming weights (GHWs) of a linear code C extend the concept of minimum distance, which is the minimum cardinality of the support of all one-dimensional subspaces of C, to the minimum cardinality of the support of all r-dimensional subspaces of the code. In this work, we introduce Cartesian square-free codes, which are linear codes generated by evaluating square-free monomials over a Cartesian set. We use commutative algebraic tools, specifically the footprint bound, to provide explicit formulas for some of the GHWs of this family of codes, and we show how we can translate these results to evaluation codes over the projective space.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文推导了共址MIMO雷达系统中DoA估计的Ziv-Zakai下界，提供了多目标场景下的闭式表达式，考虑了输入协方差矩阵、目标RCS统计特性和多快拍效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典结果主要针对单输入多输出系统和高斯输入信号，需要开发适用于一般输入协方差矩阵和多目标场景的ZZB。

Method: 推导了考虑一般输入协方差矩阵、目标RCS统计特性和多快拍效应的ZZB闭式表达式。

Result: 数值仿真验证了ZZB在先验主导区域的紧致性，增加发射天线数量压缩了向CRB过渡的阈值SNR，目标数量变化使边界行为在不同SNR区间移动。

Conclusion: ZZB比CRB更紧致，特别是在低SNR区域，为MIMO雷达DoA估计提供了更准确的理论下界。

Abstract: This paper derives a Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in co-located Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems and provides closed-form expressions that hold for multi-target scenarios. Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.
