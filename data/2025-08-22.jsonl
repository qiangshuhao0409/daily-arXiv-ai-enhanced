Canonical\ncomputational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,\nposit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation\n(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an\nalternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is\nthat these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.\nHere, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state\nrepresentation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive\naspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction\nsequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a\nconstruct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of\ngoal-equivalent experience distributions.

We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework\nproduces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours\narising naturally from any environmental setting."}

It also\nprovides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of\nheterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible\necosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,\nwe demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly\nenhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after\niterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv.

However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd.

Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly\nto collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores.

This article proposes a native AI-driven air\ninterface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and\nadaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and\nextract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task\nrelevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation\nallows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across\ndiverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and\nrobustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface\narchitecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by\na case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,\nit presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,\noutlining key challenges and research opportunities."}
