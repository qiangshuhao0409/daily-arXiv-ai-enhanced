### [1] [TeraRIS NOMA-MIMO Communications for 6G and Beyond Industrial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05130)
*Ali Raza,Muhammad Farhan Khan,Zeeshan Alam,Muhammad Saad,Ilyas Saleem,Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin,Muhammad Ali Jamshed*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合可重构智能表面（RIS）、太赫兹（THz）通信和非正交多址接入（NOMA）的联合框架，以增强智能工业通信。通过优化功率分配策略，系统在6G网络中显著提升了频谱效率、覆盖范围和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足未来6G网络中工业自动化和实时通信的需求，结合RIS和THz的优势，提升通信性能。

Method: 提出两种功率分配策略：一是优化近远节点功率分配，二是根据网络需求优先分配功率。通过仿真比较了固定功率分配方案的总速率和中断概率。

Result: 在30 dBm下，所提方案比固定功率分配方案的总速率提升了23%。仿真结果验证了RIS辅助的NOMA MIMO框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为THz工业通信提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，展示了RIS和NOMA在6G网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial
communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz
bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key
requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future
6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies
are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far
industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system
performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum
rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial
communications.

### [2] [Modular Design and Experimental Evaluation of 5G Mobile Cell Architectures Based on Overlay and Integrated Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05249)
*José Ruela,Ivan Cojocaru,André Coelho,Rui Campos,Manuel Ricardo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了5G移动单元（MC）的概念、架构设计和性能评估，用于在固定5G基础设施有限或无线条件不佳的区域提供5G连接。讨论了两种MC设计方法（覆盖模型和IAB模型），并通过仿真测试验证了MC的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在固定5G基础设施不足或无线条件恶劣的区域提供5G连接的问题。

Method: 提出两种MC设计方法（覆盖模型和IAB模型），并使用OpenAirInterface仿真测试不同MC位置的性能。

Result: 验证了MC概念，并证明MC位置对网络性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: MC架构可用于临时覆盖扩展和容量增强，适用于港口、工业场景和公共安全等环境。

Abstract: This paper presents the concept, architectural design, and performance
evaluation of a 5G Mobile Cell (MC) used to provide 5G wireless connectivity to
User Equipment (UE) in areas with limited fixed 5G infrastructures or subject
to adverse radio conditions. We consider two main approaches to MC design: an
overlay model, where the MC obtains backhaul connectivity from a 5G overlay
network, and an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB)-based model, discussing
their protocol stacks and architectural implications. In order to validate the
MC's performance, we employ an emulation-based testbed using the
OpenAirInterface (OAI) implementation, considering different MC positions. The
results validate the MC concept and demonstrate that MC positioning
significantly influences network performance. This paper has the potential to
aid network operators and service providers in selecting and deploying MC
architectures for temporary coverage extension and capacity reinforcement in
different environments, including seaports, industrial scenarios, and public
safety.

### [3] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能系统，用于工业机械的预测性维护，结合振动频率分析和多代理生成技术，提供可操作的维护建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运行效率。传统方法仅能检测异常，而缺乏具体的维护建议。

Method: 结合轴承振动频率分析（BPFO、BPFI、BSF、FTF）和多代理生成技术，将数据序列化为自然语言供LLM处理，实现高精度的异常检测和故障分类。系统还利用语义搜索和网络检索获取最新维护知识。

Result: 实验验证表明，系统能有效检测异常并提供上下文相关的维护建议，包括立即行动、检查清单、纠正措施等。

Conclusion: 该系统填补了状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白，为工业实践提供了智能决策支持，推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

### [4] [GeoFlow: Agentic Workflow Automation for Geospatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04719)
*Amulya Bhattaram,Justin Chung,Stanley Chung,Ranit Gupta,Janani Ramamoorthy,Kartikeya Gullapalli,Diana Marculescu,Dimitrios Stamoulis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFlow是一种自动生成地理空间任务代理工作流的方法，通过明确工具调用目标提升代理成功率并减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理分解中未明确API选择，GeoFlow通过详细工具调用目标解决这一问题。

Method: 为每个代理提供详细的工具调用目标，指导运行时地理空间API的调用。

Result: GeoFlow将代理成功率提高6.8%，并在主要LLM家族中减少高达四倍的token使用。

Conclusion: GeoFlow通过明确工具调用目标，显著提升了代理工作流的效率和性能。

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows
for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition
and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed
tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow
increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold
across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过对抗性棋盘游戏评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，弥补了主流问答基准方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用棋盘游戏作为战略推理和智能的典型领域，评估LLM的综合性能，减少对数据的依赖。

Method: 开发了Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估技术能力，并通过积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异大，多数LLM在对抗环境中表现乐观且适应性优于人类，但PLG揭示了技能发挥的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了新视角，但LLM在游戏中的不稳定性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

### [6] [Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for Autonomous Web-based Geographical Information Systems (AWebGIS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04846)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较三种实现AWebGIS的方法，发现基于小型语言模型（SLM）的客户端方法在准确性和隐私保护上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）方法在隐私、可扩展性和互联网依赖上的问题。

Method: 比较三种方法：1) 基于云的LLM；2) 半自动离线方法（传统机器学习）；3) 客户端SLM（T5-small）。

Result: 客户端SLM方法表现最优，准确率0.93，Levenshtein相似度0.99，ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L得分0.98。

Conclusion: 客户端SLM方法可行，能减轻服务器负担并提升隐私保护。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

### [7] [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848)
*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了强化学习（RL）在提升大语言模型（LLMs）推理能力中的作用，发现现有基准测试忽略了非理想场景下的性能。作者定义了三种非理想场景，并通过实验发现RL微调在理想场景下有效，但在非理想场景中性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估大语言模型在理想场景下的推理能力，而忽略了实际应用中常见的非理想场景，如摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤。

Method: 作者通过RL微调三种LLMs和一种大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），使用策略梯度算法，并在八个公共数据集上测试其性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，RL微调在理想场景下提升了推理能力，但在三种非理想场景中性能显著下降，暴露出当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大语言模型推理能力的局限性，并呼吁在非理想场景下评估模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

*Huiya Zhao,Yinghao Zhu,Zixiang Wang,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow是一种自我进化的AI代理，通过元级进化机制提升战略规划能力，显著优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理在医疗研究中依赖静态策略，无法成为更好的战略规划者，限制了其效能。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，通过元级进化机制自主优化问题解决策略，并开发EHRFlowBench基准进行验证。

Result: 实验表明HealthFlow显著优于现有代理框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者向自我进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [9] [The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein--Ligand Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006)
*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于博弈论的新框架（Docking Game）和LoopPlay算法，显著提升了分子对接的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多任务学习模型在配体对接中表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质结构复杂性的差异。

Method: 将蛋白-配体相互作用建模为双玩家博弈，提出LoopPlay算法，通过内外循环交替训练玩家。

Result: 在公开基准数据集上，LoopPlay比现有方法提高了约10%的准确率。

Conclusion: LoopPlay框架有望提升药物发现中分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

### [10] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）整合城市空间数据的潜力，发现其在提供相关特征时表现优异，但需结合审查与优化方法以纠正错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则方法无法覆盖所有边缘案例，机器学习方法需要大量标注数据，LLMs提供了灵活替代方案。

Method: 分析LLMs的空间推理能力，提出结合相关特征和审查优化方法。

Result: LLMs在减少空间推理依赖时表现良好，审查优化方法能有效纠正错误。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的灵活替代，未来研究方向包括多模态整合和多样化数据格式支持。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合离线模仿学习和在线探索的Web导航智能体框架CogniWeb，基于人类认知的双系统理论，实现了高效且性能优越的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web导航是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的关键领域，但现有方法未能有效整合离线学习和在线探索。

Method: 基于双系统认知理论，将智能体分解为快速直觉（System 1）和慢速推理（System 2）模块，构建了CogniWeb框架。

Result: 在WebArena上的评估显示，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，同时显著提高了效率（减少75%的token使用）。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过结合双系统认知理论，为Web导航智能体提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

*Dexuan Xu,Jieyi Wang,Zhongyan Chai,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Huamin Zhang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态医学知识编辑基准MedMKEB，用于评估医学大语言模型的知识编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识不断更新，需高效修正模型中的过时或错误信息，但目前缺乏多模态医学知识编辑的系统性评估标准。

Method: 基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集构建MedMKEB，包含反事实修正、语义泛化、知识迁移和对抗鲁棒性等任务，并引入专家验证。

Result: 实验表明现有知识编辑方法在医学领域存在局限性，需开发针对性策略。

Conclusion: MedMKEB将作为标准基准，推动可信赖且高效的医学知识编辑算法发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

*Xinyue Wu,Fan Hu,Shaik Jani Babu,Yi Zhao,Xinfei Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize是一个基于Qwen3-8B模型的轻量级门尺寸优化框架，适用于不同工艺节点和电路拓扑，显著减少人工依赖和计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有门尺寸优化方法依赖大模型、缺乏跨工艺节点通用性的问题。

Method: 结合微调的Qwen3-8B模型和动态任务特定损失函数，采用全局差分进化和局部粒子群优化进行启发式搜索。

Result: 在多个工艺节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt，减少86.67%任务的计算资源。

Conclusion: EasySize能显著简化模拟电路设计流程，减少对专家经验和计算资源的依赖。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

*Peer-Benedikt Degen,Igor Asanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI在高等教育中的作用，通过实验证明基于建构主义理论的Socratic AI Tutor能显著提升学生的批判性思维和反思能力，并提出了多代理系统（MAS）的概念，为混合学习生态系统提供了实证和理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何从边缘工具发展为重塑知识生成、传递和验证的基础设施，并探索其在教育中的潜力。

Method: 通过对比实验，65名德国职前教师学生分别与Socratic AI Tutor和普通AI聊天机器人互动，评估其对批判性思维和反思能力的支持效果。

Result: 使用Socratic Tutor的学生在批判性、独立性和反思性思维方面表现显著更好，证明了对话式AI的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究提出了多代理系统（MAS）的概念，并探讨了其在高等教育中的系统级影响，为混合学习生态系统提供了实证和理论支持。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

TL;DR: QA-Dragon是一个动态RAG系统，通过多模态检索和动态路由策略提升复杂VQA任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在文本或图像检索上孤立操作，无法满足复杂查询需求。

Method: 引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM Challenge中显著提升性能，单源、多源和多轮任务分别提升5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态多模态检索有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识更新和多跳推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号模块与神经模块松散耦合的问题，实现更紧密的集成，以提升推理的一致性和准确性。

Method: 设计了一个统一推理系统，将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入，结合LLM处理归纳推理和交互规划，通过中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%），并在临床决策和科学发现中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了一种鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出一个多维框架，定义'agent'的最低要求，并沿多个维度描述系统。

Result: 提出一个清晰的多维定义框架，为系统描述提供精确词汇，同时保留术语的多面性。

Conclusion: 建议采用标准化术语和框架，以提升研究清晰度和政策制定的有效性。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在开放多智能体环境中的行为，尤其是在法律和伦理困境中的协作与决策能力。

Method: 使用NomicLaw模拟系统，让LLMs参与协作立法，包括提出规则、论证和投票，并通过投票模式和语言策略分析信任与互惠。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在自主谈判、协调和立法起草中的潜力，为未来AI系统设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

TL;DR: StructVRM通过结构化可验证奖励模型改进多模态推理任务，提供细粒度反馈，显著提升复杂问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂多问题推理任务中表现不佳，传统二元奖励机制无法提供细粒度反馈。

Method: 提出StructVRM方法，结合结构化可验证奖励模型，提供子问题级别的语义和数学等价评估。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准测试中6个达到最优，并在高难度STEM-Bench中表现突出。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励训练是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Result: 在MetroPT数据集上，F-measure超过98%，准确率达99%，且对类别不平衡和噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在铁路预测性维护中具有实际应用价值，能快速识别故障迹象并支持决策。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Motivation: VLMs在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确行动规划，导致性能不佳，而现实任务需要复杂的交互和物理规则理解。

Method: 通过一系列具有挑战性的模拟环境，DeepPHY系统地评估VLMs的物理推理能力，并整合多难度环境和细粒度指标。

Result: 评估发现，即使最先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为评估VLMs的物理推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了其在复杂任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular

Conclusion: 呼吁开发时空感知的对齐方法，以适应不同地区的文化和法律差异。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者和开发者提供了填补评估差距的关键见解，以促进更安全和合规的AI发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且存在偏差和主观性问题，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在ERC任务中的应用有限且成本高。

Result: 生成的显著提升了ERC分类器的鲁棒性，并在现有基准上实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 小型LLM生成的多样化数据集是解决ERC数据稀缺和标签不平衡问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结合数据选择和全阶段后训练，为大规模推理模型的对齐提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用、模块化的框架，用于评估代理任务完成情况，通过分解任务并验证每个步骤，比现有方法更接近人类评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了逐步推理过程，且现有Agent-as-a-Judge系统局限于特定领域。

Method: 设计了一个模块化框架，将任务分解为子任务，验证每个步骤，并聚合模块输出以生成最终评估结果。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，提出的Judge Agent比GPT-4o基线更接近人类评估，准确率分别提高4.76%和10.52%。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通用评估方法的潜力，能够更准确地评估代理任务完成情况。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

TL;DR: MV-Debate是一种多视角代理辩论框架，用于统一多模态有害内容检测，通过动态反思门控提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态内容的复杂性使得有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息）难以识别，需解决跨模态矛盾和文化快速变化等问题。

Method: MV-Debate整合四种互补代理（表面分析师、深度推理者、模态对比者和社会情境分析者），通过迭代辩论和反思优化检测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate显著优于单一模型和现有多代理辩论基线。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论框架在提升社交媒体有害意图检测的可靠性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖大量人工奖励设计，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍了真正自主智能的发展。

Method: 结合主动推理（AIF）与大型语言模型，用自由能最小化替代外部奖励信号，实现自主目标制定与学习。

Result: 提出了一种能够自主适应环境变化、高效学习并与人类价值观对齐的AI系统框架。

Conclusion: AIF为解决自主智能的瓶颈问题提供了可行路径，结合生成模型可实现更高效的自主学习。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉学习动态或提供可解释性，因此需要新框架。

Method: 构建心理特征的学习者（如Deep、Surface、Lazy）和通用学习者，通过知识获取、测试和互动跟踪学习进展。

Result: 发现Deep Learner持续成长，Surface Learner知识浅薄，LLM默认行为是勤奋但脆弱的表面学习者。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能有效模拟真实学习场景，揭示LLM行为特征。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子通信中信息分子的高保真传输技术（如MoSK）因环境分子混合和初始浓度相同而受限，需优化发射器设计。

Method: 设计发射器从环境收集分子并存储在两储层中，消耗能量转移分子以分离混合分子，研究能量效率策略。

Result: 转移初始浓度高的分子提升性能，每次转移使用较少分子进一步提高效率。

Conclusion: 通过能量高效的分子转移技术优化分子通信系统。

Abstract: Information molecules play a crucial role in molecular communication (MC),
acting as carriers for information transfer. A common approach to get
information molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;
however, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental
molecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are
identical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as
molecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that
harvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two
reservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer
them between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores
energy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through
theoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for
moving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring
higher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while
using fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient
molecule transfer techniques.

Conclusion: 可移动天线系统在能量效率优化方面具有显著优势，能够超越传统固定天线系统。

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable
antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption
introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency
for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped
with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统G-JSD在机器学习和信息科学中应用广泛，但其仅适用于高斯分布。为了扩展其适用范围，作者提出了扩展的G-JSD，以处理更一般的正密度分布。

Method: 通过定义扩展的G-JSD，并分析其与G-JSD的差距，作者推导了多元高斯分布下的闭式解，并展示了其作为普通JSD的正则化形式。

Result: 扩展的G-JSD适用于更广泛的分布，且与G-JSD的差距可通过统计散度上下界量化。多元高斯分布下的闭式解为实际应用提供了便利。

Conclusion: 扩展的G-JSD为处理正密度分布提供了新工具，其与G-JSD的关系和闭式解为理论和应用研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

Result: 证明任何达到最优误差的协议必须对应于平衡不完全区组设计，并确定了最优协议集。

Conclusion: 最优误差和最优通信的协议仅基于对称平衡不完全区组设计。

Abstract: Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the
privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under
this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced
incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem.
However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal.
We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error
must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined
with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this
problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal
communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block
designs.

Conclusion: 提出的估计器和自适应哈希设计框架为有限块长度下的物理层安全提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Underestimating the leakage can compromise secrecy, while overestimating it
may lead to inefficient system design. Therefore, a reliable leakage estimator
is essential. Neural network-based estimators provide a data-driven way to
estimate mutual information without requiring full knowledge of the channel or
source distributions. In this work, we aim to scale the blocklength of a
wiretap code such that the estimator can still feasibly operate. We propose an
improved mutual information estimator based on the variational contrastive
log-ration upper bound framework, tailored for both discrete and continuous
variables. By using a mixture of Bernoulli experts parameterized by neural
networks, the estimator is able to quantify information leakage in
communication systems, which employ complex data processing like universal hash
family. We further propose a method to utilize the proposed estimator to design
the universal hash family for a wiretap code or secret key generation design.
Simulation results show thatprior methods significantly underestimate the
mutual information, particularly when using universal hash family for higher
blocklengths ($n\gg$16). The proposed method can scale the blocklength up to
255, and we conjecture that the design can scale well to even higher
blocklengths given adequate training data and model size. Additionally, we
contend that our proposed estimator and adaptive hash design framework offer a
practical approach for extending physical layer security considerations for
wiretap channels into the finite blocklength regime.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Abbondati et al. (2024) on decoding
simultaneous rational function codes by addressing two important scenarios:
multiplicities and poles (zeros of denominators). First, we generalize previous
results to rational codes with multiplicities by considering evaluations with
multi-precision. Then, using the hybrid model from Guerrini et al. (2023), we
extend our approach to vectors of rational functions that may present poles.
Our contributions include: a rigorous analysis of the decoding algorithm's
failure probability that generalizes and improves several previous results, an
extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be
assumed random, and a new improved analysis in the more general context
handling poles within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a
comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more
complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for
rational function codes.

Conclusion: 动态pinching波束成形能显著提升信道容量，NOMA在理想情况下非必需。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASSs) have recently shown their promising ability
to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the
positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching
beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum capacity for a
PASSassisted multiple access channel, in which multiple users transmit
individual messages to a BS under the average power constraint. To this end, we
consider a dynamic pinching beamforming setup, where multiple pinching
beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the
capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission
scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of
pinching beamforming vectors, we unveil that the optimal transmission scheme is
alternating transmission among each user with its channel power gain maximized
by dynamic pinching beamforming, which implies that the NOMA-based transmission
scheme is not needed. The corresponding sum-rate is derived in closed-form
expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum-capacity. Inspired by
this result, a lower bound of the sum-rate under an arbitrarily finite number
of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic
pinching beamforming to improve the sum capacity.

Abstract: We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the Shannon entropy $H$ of sums of $N$

Motivation: 传统MapReduce框架需要文件复制，MADC旨在减少通信开销并提高灵活性。

Conclusion: MADC模型通过组合设计优化了分布式计算的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: This paper explores the multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model, a
novel distributed computing framework where mapper and reducer nodes are
distinct entities. Unlike traditional MapReduce frameworks, MADC leverages
coding-theoretic techniques to minimize communication overhead without
necessitating file replication across mapper nodes. We introduce a new approach
utilizing combinatorial designs, specifically t-designs, to construct efficient
coding schemes that achieve a computation load of 1. By establishing a
connection between t-designs and MapReduce Arrays, we characterize the
achievable communication loads and demonstrate the flexibility of our method in
selecting the number of reducer nodes. The proposed scheme significantly
reduces the number of reducer nodes relative to existing combinatorial topology
schemes, at the expense of increased communication cost.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，证明在有限迭代次数下极化码性能优于LDPC码。

Method: 比较极化码的连续取消解码（SC）和简化连续取消解码（SSC）与LDPC码的置信传播（BP）解码。

Result: 极化码在相同LLR操作数下性能更优，SSC解码复杂度低于N logN。

Conclusion: 极化码在长码长和有限迭代下具有实际优势。

Abstract: The prevailing opinion in industry and academia is that polar codes are
competitive for short code lengths, but can no longer keep up with low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes as block length increases. This view is typically
based on the assumption that LDPC codes can be decoded with a large number of
belief propagation (BP) iterations. However, in practice, the number of
iterations may be rather limited due to latency and complexity constraints. In
this paper, we show that for a similar number of fixed-point log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) operations, long polar codes under successive cancellation (SC)
decoding outperform their LDPC counterparts. In particular, simplified
successive cancellation (SSC) decoding of polar codes exhibits a better
complexity scaling than $N \log{N}$ and requires fewer operations than a single
BP iteration of an LDPC code with the same parameters.

Abstract: While mutual information effectively quantifies dependence between two
variables, it cannot capture complex, fine-grained interactions that emerge in
multivariate systems.The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework was
introduced to address this by decomposing the mutual information between a set
of source variables and a target variable into fine-grained information atoms
such as redundant, unique, and synergistic components. In this work, we review
the axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three
main contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing
explicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full
set of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more
sources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a
three-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total
information, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based
decomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources
exceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its
inconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and
synergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of
random variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms
such as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of
high-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive
experiments on the Ising model. Our findings highlight the need for a new
framework for studying multivariate information decomposition.

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.
