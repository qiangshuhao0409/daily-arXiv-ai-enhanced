This work develops a hybrid quantum-classical\ndetection framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted\nsingle-carrier (SC) frequency-domain equalization (FDE) over\nfrequency-selective channels. The ML detection objective is reformulated as a\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and solved via\nGrover adaptive search (GAS). To accelerate convergence, we introduce a\nfrequency-domain MMSE threshold that exploits the circulant structure of SC-FDE\nchannels, yielding low-complexity initialization. The framework is evaluated\nacross varying channel lengths and RIS sizes, confirming robustness and\nscalability. In addition, GAS requirements are quantified through register\nwidths and gate counts, and its query complexity is analyzed to characterize\nthe algorithm's cost for block transmission in frequency-selective channels.\nQuantum circuit simulations are conducted in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy\nconditions. In the ideal case, the detector achieves near-optimal performance\nwhile benefiting from Grover's quadratic speedup, reducing the search cost from\nfrom O(M^N) exhaustive evaluations to O(SQRT(M^N)) oracle queries. Under noise,\nthe shallow depth of the GAS circuits, aided by MMSE initialization, makes\ndepolarizing errors negligible, while readout errors introduce moderate\ndegradation yet still preserve performance close to the MMSE baseline. These\nresults establish the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detection for\nRIS-assisted broadband communications, highlighting both algorithmic\nscalability and practical robustness for 6G networks."}

While DCQCN provides a\nscalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is\nslow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources\n(which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it\ndiminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios\nidentification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network\nresource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called\nImproved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so\nthat the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN\nmarking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being\nmarked.

Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,\nand Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information\nencoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding\nsimilarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values.

We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures.

We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan.

Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making."}

Submitted to Nature Water. Partially presented at\n  HydroML 2025 Symposium, Minnesota Water Resources Conference 2025, and will\n  be presented at AGU Fall Meeting 2025", "summary": "Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming\ndrainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood\nprediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,\npractical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full\nimplementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow\nconditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further\nintegrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time\ncontrol under limited sensing and monitoring resource."}

To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems.

On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis", "comment": "Accepted to the AI for Tabular Data workshop at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent\nto queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more\ninformed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular\ndata, for which we outline implications and directions for future research."}

While participants are typically invited to\npropose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due\nto time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of\nquestions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce\nan auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a\nslate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified\nrepresentation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the\ngeneral utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime\nof $O(mn\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number\nof proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical\ndeliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions\nposed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions\nchosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current\nlimitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our\nmethods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over\nhundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for\npractitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

Even when they reach correct\nanswers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a\nneuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from\nCoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order\nlogic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,\ncommonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps.
