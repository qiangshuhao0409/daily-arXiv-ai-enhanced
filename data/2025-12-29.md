<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RSRP预测方法存在精度和真实性不足的问题，仅考虑大尺度信息，难以捕捉大尺度和小尺度信号衰减的复杂交织特性，且缺乏物理先验知识导致准确性、可解释性和可迁移性弱

Conclusion: 提出的Channel-Diff框架通过融合多尺度物理先验知识和条件扩散模型，显著提升了RSRP预测的准确性、可解释性和可迁移性，为移动网络通信性能优化提供了有效工具

Abstract: The Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) is a crucial factor that determines communication performance in mobile networks. Accurately predicting the RSRP can help network operators perceive user experiences and maximize throughput by optimizing wireless resources. However, existing research into RSRP prediction has limitations in accuracy and verisimilitude. Theoretical derivations and existing data-driven methods consider only easily quantifiable Large-Scale (LS) information, and struggle to effectively capture the intertwined LS and Small-Scale (SS) signal attenuation characteristics of the wireless channel. Moreover, the lack of prior physical knowledge leads to weak accuracy, interpretability, and transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel RSRP prediction framework, Channel-Diff. This framework physically models LS and SS attenuation using multimodal conditions and employs physics-informed conditional diffusion models as the prediction network. Channel-Diff extracts prior physical information that characterises the signal propagation process from network parameters and multi-attribute maps of the urban spatial environment. It provides LS physical priors through large-scale propagation modelling and shadow-occlusion modelling, and SS physical priors through multipath propagation modelling and urban microenvironment feature extraction. We design a physical-prior-guided two-stage training scheme with a noise prior guidance mechanism, enabling effective fusion of multi-scale physical knowledge with the diffusion models. Evaluations demonstrate Channel-Diff exhibits excellent performance on RSRP prediction, achieving at least 25.15%-37.19% improvement in accuracy relative to baseline methods. Additionally, the model also demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of transferability and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文综述了空天地一体化网络支持的多连接技术，分析了其实现挑战，并展示了基于智能体强化学习的资源分配优化方法，显著提升了网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空天地一体化网络支持的多连接技术是下一代网络的关键使能技术，但TN和NTN的异构性带来了复杂的架构挑战，使得多连接实现困难。需要解决多种链路类型（空对空、空对空间、空间对空间、空间对地、地对地）下的最优资源分配问题。

Method: 论文采用综述研究方法，回顾了SAGIN支持的多连接技术发展现状，分析了关键挑战，并提出了基于智能体强化学习的AI驱动方法进行资源优化。通过一个涉及多种无线接入技术的案例研究，展示了智能体强化学习在资源分配优化中的应用。

Conclusion: AI驱动的方法在异构SAGIN环境中的资源优化具有变革性潜力。论文最后提出了开放研究问题和未来方向，以实现高效的SAGIN支持的多连接技术。

Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.

### [3] [Meta-Learning-Based Handover Management in NextG O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22022)
*Michail Kalntis,George Iosifidis,José Suárez-Varela,Andra Lutu,Fernando A. Kuipers*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出CONTRA框架，在O-RAN架构中联合优化传统切换和条件切换，通过元学习算法自适应决策切换类型，提升吞吐量并降低切换成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切换在高密度部署和高频段中失败率和延迟增加，条件切换虽然提供主动预留但仍存在信令、资源使用和可靠性之间的复杂权衡，需要自适应和鲁棒的切换控制。

Method: 提出CONTRA框架，包含两种变体：1) 用户预先分配切换类型；2) 控制器根据系统条件动态决策切换类型。采用实用的元学习算法，适应运行时观测并保证与完美未来信息预言机相当的性能。

Result: 基于众包数据集的广泛评估显示，CONTRA提高了用户吞吐量，降低了传统切换和条件切换的切换成本，在动态和真实场景中优于3GPP兼容和强化学习基线。

Conclusion: CONTRA作为O-RAN xApp设计，支持近实时部署，符合6G灵活智能控制目标，为下一代网络提供了自适应和鲁棒的切换控制框架。

Abstract: While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.

### [4] [Schwarz Information Criterion Aided Multi-Armed Bandit for Decentralized Resource Allocation in Dynamic LoRa Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22089)
*Ryotai Ariyoshi,Aohan Li,Mikio Hasegawa,Tomoaki Ohtsuki,Miao Pan,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级分布式学习方法，用于LoRa网络中的传输参数选择，通过UCB1-tuned算法结合SIC变化检测机制，在动态通信环境中优化传输成功率和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRa网络中需要动态选择传输参数（信道、功率、带宽）以适应变化的通信环境。传统UCB1-tuned算法在静态条件下有效，但在动态环境中适应缓慢，因为过度依赖历史观测数据。

Method: 每个LoRa终端设备使用UCB1-tuned算法选择传输参数，基于网关的ACK反馈和能耗信息。引入Schwarz信息准则(SIC)检测通信环境变化，当检测到变化时重置UCB1-tuned的学习历史，实现快速重新学习。

Result: 使用真实LoRa设备的实验结果表明，相比传统UCB1-tuned算法，所提方法在传输成功率、能效和适应性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级分布式学习方法通过结合UCB1-tuned和SIC变化检测，有效解决了LoRa网络在动态环境中的参数选择问题，实现了更好的传输性能和能效平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a lightweight distributed learning method for transmission parameter selection in Long Range (LoRa) networks that can adapt to dynamic communication environments. In the proposed method, each LoRa End Device (ED) employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)1-tuned algorithm to select transmission parameters including channel, transmission power, and bandwidth. The transmission parameters are selected based on the acknowledgment (ACK) feedback returned from the gateway after each transmission and the corresponding transmission energy consumption. Hence, it enables devices to simultaneously optimize transmission success rate and energy efficiency in a fully distributed manner. However, although UCB1-tuned based method is effective under stationary conditions, it suffers from slow adaptation in dynamic environments due to its strong reliance on historical observations. To address this limitation, we integrate the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) to our proposed method. SIC is adopted because it enables low-cost detection of changes in the communication environment, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained LoRa EDs. When a change is detected by SIC, the learning history of UCB1-tuned is reset, allowing rapid re-learning under the new conditions. Experimental results using real LoRa devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior transmission success rate, energy efficiency, and adaptability compared with the conventional UCB1-tuned algorithm without SIC.

*Shuide Wen,Yu Sun,Beier Ku,Zhi Gao,Lijun Ma,Yang Yang,Can Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型和多智能体协作的HTP绘画测试自动分析框架，实现了接近专家水平的标准化评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的HTP绘画测试存在评分标准不统一、依赖评估者主观经验、缺乏统一量化编码系统等问题，需要开发标准化、客观化的评估工具

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型分析绘画内容，通过多智能体协作框架，将特征识别与心理推断解耦，整合社会心理学视角和去污名化叙事

Result: MLLM解释与人类专家解释的平均语义相似度约0.75（标准差0.05），在结构化专家数据集中提升至0.85；多智能体系统能有效纠正视觉幻觉，生成具有高生态效度和内在一致性的心理报告

Conclusion: 多模态大模型可作为投射评估的标准化工具，多智能体框架为数字心理健康服务提供了新范式，通过角色分工实现了特征识别与心理推断的解耦

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.
  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

### [7] [Three-way conflict analysis based on alliance and conflict functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21419)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Result: 提出的分离函数方法能够更精确地表示代理间关系，解决了传统聚合中的语义模糊问题。通过实际应用展示了该方法在解决冲突分析关键问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: 将辅助函数拆分为联盟和冲突函数对能够提供更清晰的语义表达，增强冲突分析的准确性。该方法为理解代理关系、联盟策略等关键问题提供了更好的理论框架。

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于加权一致性和非一致性度量的三方冲突分析新方法，用于识别可行策略和最优解，超越了传统仅关注冲突理解的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三方冲突分析主要关注冲突理解（如三分代理对、代理或议题），但缺乏解决冲突的实际策略制定方法。特别是可行策略的制定作为冲突解决和缓解的关键组成部分，在学术研究中关注不足。

Method: 1. 基于正负相似度计算代理团的总体评分；2. 考虑代理和议题的权重，提出加权一致性和非一致性度量；3. 开发算法识别可行策略、L阶可行策略及相应最优策略；4. 在NBA劳资谈判和甘肃省发展规划两个案例中应用模型，并进行参数敏感性分析和与现有方法的比较分析。

Result: 提出的冲突解决模型优于传统方法，通过统一加权代理-议题评估与一致性和非一致性度量，能够系统识别可行策略和最优解。比较结果表明该方法在实用性和有效性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 该研究从一致性和非一致性两个视角探讨了可行策略的识别，为三方冲突分析提供了实用的解决框架，超越了传统仅关注冲突理解的方法，在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

Conclusion: 本文提出的近似性概念和概念形式化的两种方法为不完备信息分析指出了新的有前景的研究方向，虽然相似类分析是文献中常见方法，但本文的创新点在于提出了新的分析视角和工具。

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Leash框架，通过自适应长度惩罚和奖励塑造，在保持任务性能的同时将推理长度减少60%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定长度惩罚方法难以调优，无法适应LLM不断发展的推理能力，导致准确性和简洁性之间的次优权衡

Method: 将长度控制建模为约束优化问题，采用拉格朗日原始对偶方法动态调整惩罚系数，生成超过目标长度时加强惩罚，较短时放松惩罚

Result: 在Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507上，Leash在多样化任务中将平均推理长度减少60%，同时保持竞争力性能

Conclusion: Leash为开发可控高效LLM提供了实用有效范式，平衡推理能力和计算预算

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.

TL;DR: 基于LLaVA的医学诊断框架，结合视觉语言对齐与逻辑正则化推理，提高多模态医疗AI的可信度和诊断准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在医学应用中，简单整合临床文本和医学影像无法保证可靠推理，现有多模态模型常产生幻觉或不一致的思维链，限制了临床信任度

Method: 提出基于LLaVA的诊断框架，包含文本和图像输入编码器、跨模态对齐投影模块、将诊断任务分解为步骤的推理控制器，以及将逐步前提组装为可验证结论的逻辑树生成器

Result: 在MedXpertQA等基准测试中，该方法提高了诊断准确性，在多模态任务上产生更可解释的推理轨迹，同时在纯文本设置中保持竞争力

Conclusion: 该方法为实现可信赖的多模态医疗AI迈出了有希望的一步

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AMS IC设计中I/O子系统生成需要大量人工工作且耗时，需要将自然语言设计意图与工业级设计流程有效连接，提高自动化水平和设计效率。

Method: 开发包含结构化领域知识库和设计意图结构化能力的框架，使用JSON和Python作为中间格式将模糊用户意图转换为可验证逻辑步骤，并创建AMS-IO-Bench基准测试。

Conclusion: 这是首个报道的人机协作AMS IC设计，其中基于LLM的代理完成了非平凡子任务且输出直接用于硅片制造，展示了在实际设计流程中的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

Motivation: 解决LLM应用、边缘智能等场景中的资源分配问题，其中资源具有随机容量，且不同任务具有优先级权重，需要优先满足高优先级任务的需求。

Method: 提出MSB-PRS-OffOpt算法，计算复杂度O(MK³)，用于寻找最优分配策略；基于此设计近似UCB算法，处理优先级资源分配机制带来的非线性组合效用函数优化问题。

Result: 证明了实例独立下界Ω(α₁σ√KMT)和实例依赖下界Ω(α₁σ²(M/Δ)lnT)，设计的算法上界分别匹配下界至√(K ln KT)和α₁K²因子。

Conclusion: 成功解决了优先级资源分配机制下的随机赌博机问题，建立了理论界限并设计了高效算法，为实际应用中的资源分配提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

Conclusion: CRS框架和开源库为解决生成式AI数据集中的伦理和法律问题提供了实用工具，促进了数据集透明度、问责制和安全性原则的落实。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Motivation: 空间转录组学数据规模和复杂性快速增加，计算分析成为生物学发现的主要瓶颈。虽然前沿AI代理在软件工程和通用数据分析方面进步显著，但尚不清楚它们是否能从混乱的真实空间数据集中提取生物学见解。

Method: 引入SpatialBench基准测试，包含146个从实际空间分析工作流程中提取的可验证问题，涵盖五种空间技术和七个任务类别。每个问题提供实验数据快照和确定性评分器，用于评估关键生物学结果的恢复情况。

Result: 前沿模型在基准测试上的准确率仍然较低（20-38%，不同模型家族间有差异），存在强烈的模型-任务和模型-平台交互作用。工具设计对性能有显著影响，表明工具、提示、控制流和执行环境应作为首要评估和改进对象。

Conclusion: SpatialBench既可作为测量工具，也可作为诊断视角，用于开发能够忠实、透明且可重复地与真实空间数据集交互的AI代理。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法大多将稀疏性视为外部约束，通过启发式重要性评分或训练时正则化强制实现。本文提出从根本上不同的视角：将剪枝视为模型组件战略互动的均衡结果，为剪枝行为提供理论解释。

Method: 将权重、神经元或滤波器等参数组建模为连续非合作博弈中的参与者，每个参与者选择在网络中的参与程度，平衡贡献与冗余和竞争。在均衡状态下，当继续参与成为劣势策略时，参与者自然归零，实现剪枝。

Conclusion: 将剪枝建模为均衡现象提供了理论依据，稀疏性作为战略互动的自然结果涌现，为神经网络剪枝提供了新的理论基础和解释框架。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: 提出的基于设备状态的离线与在线学习方法能够有效实现TDMR系统中LOCO编码方案的自适应重配置，优于传统的基于时间戳的方法，能够延长设备寿命并优化系统性能。

Abstract: In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale position-reconfigurable antennas have opened up new dimensions to effectively utilize the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wireless channels. However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于前向-后向马尔可夫决策过程（FB-MDP）和强化学习的动态缓存策略，用于优化蜂窝网络中的流媒体延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有缓存功能的基站蜂窝网络中，用户如果未能通过多点组播流媒体获得所需内容，会产生交付中断，导致用户偏好持续存在并形成前向动态。同时，延迟的动态特性表现为后向动态，需要综合考虑这两种动态来设计最优的流媒体策略。

Method: 将网络建模为前向-后向马尔可夫决策过程（FB-MDP），结合用户偏好的前向动态和延迟的后向动态。采用前向-后向多目标强化学习（FB-MORL）算法，同时优化预期延迟、总体中断概率和总资源消耗等多个性能指标。

Conclusion: 通过将网络动态建模为FB-MDP并采用FB-MORL算法，可以设计出延迟最优的流媒体策略，该框架能够全面捕捉网络随时间演化的特性，为缓存网络优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a cellular network equipped with cache-enabled base-stations (BSs) leveraging an orthogonal multipoint multicast (OMPMC) streaming scheme. The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption. Simulation results show the merit of proposed FB-MORL algorithm in finding a promising dynamic cache policy.

Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive low-SNR analysis, offering meaningful observations on how key system parameters influence the capacity performance.
