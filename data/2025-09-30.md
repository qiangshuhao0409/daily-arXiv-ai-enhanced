### [1] [Bridging Language Models and Formal Methods for Intent-Driven Optical Network Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22834)
*Anis Bekri,Amar Abane,Abdella Battou,Saddek Bensalem*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM意图解析、形式化方法和光学RAG的混合管道，将自然语言意图转化为可验证的光网络拓扑设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在将非正式自然语言意图转化为正式正确光网络拓扑时的模糊性和严谨性不足问题

Method: 集成LLM意图解析、形式化方法和光学检索增强生成(RAG)，通过领域特定光学标准丰富设计决策，并系统整合符号推理和验证技术

Result: 生成可解释、可验证且可信赖的光网络设计

Conclusion: 该方法通过确保可靠性和正确性，显著推进了基于意图的网络，对关键任务网络应用至关重要

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) aims to simplify network management by enabling
users to specify high-level goals that drive automated network design and
configuration. However, translating informal natural-language intents into
formally correct optical network topologies remains challenging due to inherent
ambiguity and lack of rigor in Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid pipeline that integrates LLM-based intent parsing,
formal methods, and Optical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By enriching
design decisions with domain-specific optical standards and systematically
incorporating symbolic reasoning and verification techniques, our pipeline
generates explainable, verifiable, and trustworthy optical network designs.
This approach significantly advances IBN by ensuring reliability and
correctness, essential for mission-critical networking tasks.

### [2] [Impact of Environmental Factors on LoRa 2.4 GHz Time of Flight Ranging Outdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23125)
*Yiqing Zhou,Xule Zhou,Zecan Cheng,Chenao Lu,Junhan Chen,Jiahong Pan,Yizhuo Liu,Sihao Li,Kyeong Soo Kim*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 针对LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF测距技术，收集了包含温湿度环境因素的三周室外数据集，通过DNN模型发现环境因素显著影响测距精度，需要开发补偿方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSN/IoT节点定位对大规模环境监测至关重要，但现有技术受限于时间分辨率和时间戳抖动，无法提供米级精度。LoRa 2.4 GHz提供了RF ToF测距方法，但现有数据集覆盖范围有限且未考虑温湿度等环境因素。

Method: 在XJTLU南校区运动场收集LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF测距数据，三个LoRa节点与基站进行测距采样，同时记录温湿度数据，在400平方米的3x3网格参考点上持续三周测量，使用ESP32基站传输数据。

Result: 基于简单DNN模型的初步研究表明，温度和湿度等环境因素显著影响测距精度。

Conclusion: 环境因素对室外LoRa RF ToF测距有显著影响，需要开发先进的方法来补偿这些环境因素的影响。

Abstract: In WSN/IoT, node localization is essential to long-running applications for
accurate environment monitoring and event detection, often covering a large
area in the field. Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT
platforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in
timestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level
resolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide
interoperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4
GHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of
flight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing
datasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not
take into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and
humidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was
collected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes
logged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature
and humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square
meter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station
equipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications.
The results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural
network (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the
temperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which
calls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental
factors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors.

### [3] [Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23216)
*Po-Heng Chou*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文研究了LAA与Wi-Fi在非授权频段共存时的干扰问题，提出了四种非授权频段分配方案，并通过分析模型和仿真实验评估了这些方案在LAA缓冲队列中数据包接受率方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LAA与Wi-Fi异构网络中，当两个系统使用相同的非授权信道时会产生相互干扰，非授权频段分配方案会显著影响两个系统的服务质量，因此需要研究有效的频段分配策略。

Method: 提出了四种非授权频段分配方案：非授权全分配(UFA)、非授权时分分配(UTA)，以及带缓冲机制的UFA/UTA(UFAB和UTAB)，并建立了分析模型和进行了仿真实验。

Result: 评估了这些分配方案在LAA缓冲队列中LAA和Wi-Fi数据包接受率方面的性能表现，为设计LAA小基站的信道占用阶段和缓冲区大小提供了指导。

Conclusion: 研究为LAA小基站的信道占用阶段和缓冲区大小设计提供了指导原则，有助于优化LAA与Wi-Fi在非授权频段共存时的网络性能。

Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA
coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with
high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and
Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use
the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network,
unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may
affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this
paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to
study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation
(UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering
mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance
of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of
both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides
guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of
the LAA small cell.

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation
experiments to study listen-before-talk-based unlicensed band allocation with
the buffering mechanism for the License-Assisted Access (LAA) packets in the
heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA
and Wi-Fi is an important issue, which may affect the quality of service for
both systems significantly. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed
band allocations in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packets.
This letter provides the guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase
and buffer threshold of the LAA systems.

### [5] [Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23218)
*Po-Heng Chou,Yen-Ting Liu,Wei-Chang Chen,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于D2D辅助蜂窝网络的资源分配分析模型，支持underlay和overlay D2D系统，考虑了与Wi-Fi系统的未授权频段共享问题，采用基于阈值的流控制保证Wi-Fi服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决D2D辅助蜂窝网络中资源分配问题，同时考虑与Wi-Fi系统在未授权频段上的共存，需要保证Wi-Fi用户的服务质量。

Method: 开发全局系统状态模型反映D2D、传统蜂窝和Wi-Fi数据包的交互，在标准流量模型假设下提出基于阈值的流控制机制。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案在略微牺牲传统蜂窝性能的同时显著提升overlay D2D性能，同时保持Wi-Fi用户性能，比underlay方案在D2D和Wi-Fi之间具有更灵活的调节能力。

Conclusion: 提出的资源分配模型能有效平衡D2D、传统蜂窝和Wi-Fi系统的性能需求，为D2D辅助蜂窝网络提供了实用的资源管理方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed
for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can
be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and
offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the
problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a
global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular,
and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a
threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the
quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then
derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional
cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly
while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed
scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay
scheme.

### [6] [A Modular KDN-Based Framework for IT/OT Autonomy in Industrial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23389)
*Tuğçe Bilen,Mehmet Ozdem*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出基于知识定义网络(KDN)的模块化框架，实现IT-OT基础设施的自适应自主控制，通过四个核心模块的闭环控制提升工业网络弹性、响应性和运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则或静态管理方法无法满足工业环境中日益增长的复杂性、异构性和实时性需求，需要更智能的自适应控制方案。

Method: 采用四模块架构：遥测收集器、知识构建器、决策引擎和控制执行器，使用基于图的抽象表示系统状态，通过效用优化机制在动态条件下指导控制决策。

Result: 评估了决策延迟、控制有效性和系统稳定性三个关键指标，证明该框架能够增强智能工业网络的弹性、响应性和运行效率。

Conclusion: 基于KDN的模块化框架为IT-OT融合提供了有效的自适应自主控制解决方案，能够满足现代工业环境的复杂需求。

Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology
(OT) is a critical enabler for achieving autonomous and intelligent industrial
systems. However, the increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and real-time
demands of industrial environments render traditional rule-based or static
management approaches insufficient. In this paper, we present a modular
framework based on the Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) paradigm, enabling
adaptive and autonomous control across IT-OT infrastructures. The proposed
architecture is composed of four core modules: Telemetry Collector, Knowledge
Builder, Decision Engine, and Control Enforcer. These modules operate in a
closed control loop to continuously observe system behavior, extract contextual
knowledge, evaluate control actions, and apply policy decisions across
programmable industrial endpoints. A graph-based abstraction is used to
represent system state, and a utility-optimization mechanism guides control
decisions under dynamic conditions. The framework's performance is evaluated
using three key metrics: decision latency, control effectiveness, and system
stability, demonstrating its capability to enhance resilience, responsiveness,
and operational efficiency in smart industrial networks.

### [7] [Knowledge-Defined and Twin-Assisted Network Management for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23398)
*Tuğçe Bilen,Mehmet Özdem*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成数字孪生、语义推理和零样本学习的模块化知识定义架构，用于6G网络的自主决策管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络日益复杂、动态和异构的特性需要能够主动推理并超越预定义案例的管理系统。

Method: 使用数字孪生模型维护物理网络的同步虚拟副本并预测状态转换，通过知识平面构建图网络抽象实现上下文感知意图生成，管理平面通过语义嵌入实现零样本策略匹配。

Result: 仿真结果显示该框架在策略响应时间、SLA合规率和意图匹配准确性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该架构能够为未见过的网络场景实现自主决策，并通过闭环反馈机制持续优化预测、知识和策略。

Abstract: The increasing complexity, dynamism, and heterogeneity of 6G networks demand
management systems that can reason proactively and generalize beyond
pre-defined cases. In this paper, we propose a modular, knowledge-defined
architecture that integrates Digital Twin models with semantic reasoning and
zero-shot learning to enable autonomous decision-making for previously unseen
network scenarios. Real-time data streams are used to maintain synchronized
virtual replicas of the physical network, which also forecast short-term state
transitions. These predictions feed into a knowledge plane that constructs and
updates a graph-based abstraction of the network, enabling context-aware intent
generation via graph neural reasoning. To ensure adaptability without
retraining, the management plane performs zero-shot policy matching by
semantically embedding candidate intents and selecting suitable pre-learned
actions. The selected decisions are translated and enforced through the control
plane, while a closed-loop feedback mechanism continuously refines predictions,
knowledge, and policies over time. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
framework observes notable improvements in policy response time, SLA compliance
rate, and intent matching accuracy.

### [8] [AUV-Assisted Underwater 6G: Environmental Modeling and Multi-Stage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23401)
*Mustafa Yavuz Engin,Mehmet Ozdem,Tuğçe Bilen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一个水下6G网络仿真模型，通过K-Means聚类结合遗传算法和粒子群优化来优化传感器、AUV和枢纽的布局，考虑环境因素对电磁信号传输的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下6G网络部署面临环境因素（温度、盐度、电导率）对电磁信号传输的挑战，需要优化网络架构以提高性能。

Method: 采用K-Means聚类进行初始分组，然后顺序应用遗传算法和粒子群优化来优化集群配置，仿真包含多跳数据传输、集群领导选择等网络动态。

Result: 通过对比有无集群领导的两种场景，证明6G网络架构在水下环境中能够有效建模和优化，考虑环境条件可提升网络性能。

Conclusion: 水下6G网络可以通过结合环境条件的优化算法有效建模，为实际部署提供理论支持。

Abstract: This study presents a simulation model for underwater 6G networks, focusing
on the optimized placement of sensors, AUVs, and hubs. The network architecture
consists of fixed hub stations, mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs),
and numerous sensor nodes. Environmental parameters such as temperature,
salinity, and conductivity are considered in the transmission of
electromagnetic signals; signal attenuation and transmission delays are
calculated based on physical models. The optimization process begins with
K-Means clustering, followed by sequential application of Genetic Algorithm
(GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to refine the cluster
configurations. The simulation includes key network dynamics such as multi-hop
data transmission, cluster leader selection, queue management, and traffic load
balancing. To compare performance, two distinct scenarios -- one with cluster
leaders and one without -- are modeled and visualized through a PyQt5-based
real-time graphical interface. The results demonstrate that 6G network
architectures in underwater environments can be effectively modeled and
optimized by incorporating environmental conditions.

### [9] [Network Traffic Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning and Confident Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23522)
*Ehsan Eslami,Walaa Hamouda*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合自监督学习和置信度学习的新型网络流量分类框架，通过生成伪标签减少对标注数据的依赖，在多个数据集上实现了优于现有方法的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络流量分类方法（如DPI和端口识别）难以处理加密流量和动态端口分配，监督学习方法需要大量标注数据但获取困难，无监督学习方法准确率较低。

Method: 首先使用自监督学习（如自编码器或表格对比学习）从大量未标注数据生成伪标签，然后应用流量适应的置信度学习来精炼这些伪标签，减少噪声影响。

Result: 在三个数据集（ISCX VPN-nonVPN、自生成数据集和UCDavis-QUIC）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在分类准确率上优于最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个通用的解决方案，在最小化标注数据需求的同时实现了高准确率的网络流量分类。

Abstract: Network traffic classification (NTC) is vital for efficient network
management, security, and performance optimization, particularly with 5G/6G
technologies. Traditional methods, such as deep packet inspection (DPI) and
port-based identification, struggle with the rise of encrypted traffic and
dynamic port allocations. Supervised learning methods provide viable
alternatives but rely on large labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire
given the diversity and volume of network traffic. Meanwhile, unsupervised
learning methods, while less reliant on labeled data, often exhibit lower
accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that first
leverages Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with techniques such as autoencoders
or Tabular Contrastive Learning (TabCL) to generate pseudo-labels from
extensive unlabeled datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data.
We then apply traffic-adopted Confident Learning (CL) to refine these
pseudo-labels, enhancing classification precision by mitigating the impact of
noise. Our proposed framework offers a generalizable solution that minimizes
the need for extensive labeled data while delivering high accuracy. Extensive
simulations and evaluations, conducted using three datasets (ISCX VPN-nonVPN,
self-generated dataset, and UCDavis--QUIC), and demonstrate that our method
achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques in
classifying network traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI/ML技术在蜂窝无线接入网络中显示出显著性能提升潜力，但AI无线系统在真实环境中仍缺乏测试。仿真训练存在"现实差距"问题，且开发高性能概念验证实现成本高、复杂度大。

Method: 采用详细数字孪生仿真训练站点特定的AI物理层功能，并开发强大的AI-RAN研究测试平台，支持快速原型设计、现场测试和数据收集。

Abstract: Following state-of-the-art research results, which showed the potential for
significant performance gains by applying AI/ML techniques in the cellular
Radio Access Network (RAN), the wireless industry is now broadly pushing for
the adoption of AI in 5G and future 6G technology. Despite this enthusiasm,
AI-based wireless systems still remain largely untested in the field. Common
simulation methods for generating datasets for AI model training suffer from
"reality gap" and, as a result, the performance of these simulation-trained
models may not carry over to practical cellular systems. Additionally, the cost
and complexity of developing high-performance proof-of-concept implementations
present major hurdles for evaluating AI wireless systems in the field. In this
work, we introduce a methodology which aims to address the challenges of
bringing AI to real networks. We discuss how detailed Digital Twin simulations
may be employed for training site-specific AI Physical (PHY) layer functions.
We further present a powerful testbed for AI-RAN research and demonstrate how
it enables rapid prototyping, field testing and data collection. Finally, we
evaluate an AI channel estimation algorithm over-the-air with a commercial UE,
demonstrating that real-world throughput gains of up to 40% are achievable by
incorporating AI in the physical layer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于描述无人机道路系统的标记语言和一种去中心化的贪婪引导算法，通过局部信息实现实时决策，确保无人机在密集环境中的安全和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机在城市环境中的使用增加，密集区域避免碰撞和有效管理空中交通成为重要挑战，需要结构化的道路系统和有效的引导算法。

Method: 引入描述无人机道路系统的标记语言，并提出短期去中心化贪婪（STDG）引导算法，仅使用附近无人机的位置和速度信息进行实时决策。

Result: 仿真结果显示关键无线和算法参数对无人机碰撞率、平均速度和系统吞吐量等性能指标的影响。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法使无人机能够独立运行，同时确保安全性和效率，相比依赖集中协调的现有方法具有优势。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have experienced
expanding use in urban environments in recent years. However, the growing
density of drones raises significant challenges, such as avoiding collisions
and managing air traffic efficiently, especially in congested areas. To address
these issues, a structured road system and an effective guidance algorithm are
essential. In this paper, we introduce a markup language allowing to describe
drone road systems (DRS), in which a road system is given by a set of
individual roads, each of which can have a varying number of lanes. Roads can
be linked through connecting lanes. Furthermore, we propose a novel short-term
decentralized greedy (STDG) guidance algorithm that uses only the position and
speed information of nearby drones -- communicated via periodically transmitted
beacons -- to make real-time decisions such as stopping, changing lanes, or
adjusting speed for the next few seconds. Unlike existing methods that rely on
centralized coordination, our algorithm enables drones to operate independently
while ensuring safety and efficiency. We present simulation results showing the
impact of key wireless and algorithm parameters on performance metrics like the
drone collision rate, average speed and throughput of the drone road system.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了低空经济智能通信与算力网络之间的协同作用，分析了双方如何相互增强，并提出了集成系统的设计原则和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济智能通信面临计算能力有限、跨场景泛化不足和需求异构性等挑战，而算力网络也存在静态部署和适应性有限的问题。研究两者的协同可以构建更灵活、自适应的架构。

Method: 通过分析CPNs如何支持LAE智能通信（如空-地协同控制、AI训练、通信-计算协同优化等），以及LAE如何增强CPNs（如移动辅助控制、分布式智能训练等），探索协同潜力。

Result: 提出了CPN-LAE集成系统的设计原则和未来研究方向，为构建灵活、自适应和弹性的低空服务架构提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过CPNs和LAE的协同，可以构建高质量、可持续的低空服务架构，解决各自面临的挑战并实现相互增强。

Abstract: The rapid development of the Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) has created
opportunities for emerging services such as autonomous aerial transportation,
aerial sensing, and emergency response, all of which rely on efficient and
intelligent communications. However, LAE intelligent communications face
several challenges, including the limited computational capacity of aerial
nodes, the lack of cross-scenario generalization, and the complexity of
heterogeneous demands. Meanwhile, Computing Power Networks (CPNs) have emerged
as a new paradigm for integrating distributed computing, networking, and
storage resources, but they are also constrained by static deployment and
limited adaptability. In this survey, we explore the synergy between LAE
intelligent communications and CPNs. We first analyze how CPNs can support LAE
intelligent communications in areas such as air-ground collaborative control,
AI training, communication-computation co-ptimization, and ubiquitous
low-altitude information processing. Conversely, we discuss how LAE intelligent
communications can enhance CPNs through mobility-assisted control, distributed
intelligent training, dynamic routing, and in-network aerial computing.
Finally, based on these insights, we outline design principles and future
research directions for integrated CPN-LAE systems. This work provides a
comprehensive foundation for building flexible, adaptive, and resilient
architectures that leverage the synergy between CPNs and LAE to deliver
high-quality and sustainable low-altitude services.

*Cheonjin Park,Victoria Manfredi,Xiaolan Zhang,Chengyi Liu,Alicia P Wolfe,Dongjin Song,Sarah Tasneem,Bing Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可泛化的深度强化学习框架，用于多跳移动无线网络的转发策略设计，通过基础模型和微调机制适应新场景，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习转发策略在训练环境相似时表现良好，但在与训练环境显著不同的场景中缺乏泛化能力，这限制了其在实际网络中的应用。

Method: 开发了可泛化的基础模型，设计了新的网络变化和特征质量表征特征，采用持续学习方法防止灾难性遗忘，并支持使用少量新场景数据进行微调。

Result: 在包括两个城市真实场景的广泛评估中，该方法对未见过的移动场景具有良好泛化能力，相比最先进的启发式转发策略，延迟降低高达78%，投递率提升24%，转发次数相当或略高。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了深度强化学习在多跳移动无线网络中的泛化问题，通过基础模型和微调机制实现了对多样化网络场景的有效适应。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully used to design
forwarding strategies for multi-hop mobile wireless networks. While such
strategies can be used directly for networks with varied connectivity and
dynamic conditions, developing generalizable approaches that are effective on
scenarios significantly different from the training environment remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the challenge of
generalizability by (i) developing a generalizable base model considering
diverse mobile network scenarios, and (ii) using the generalizable base model
for new scenarios, and when needed, fine-tuning the base model using a small
amount of data from the new scenarios. To support this framework, we first
design new features to characterize network variation and feature quality,
thereby improving the information used in DRL-based forwarding decisions. We
then develop a continual learning (CL) approach able to train DRL models across
diverse network scenarios without ``catastrophic forgetting.'' Using extensive
evaluation, including real-world scenarios in two cities, we show that our
approach is generalizable to unseen mobility scenarios. Compared to a
state-of-the-art heuristic forwarding strategy, it leads to up to 78% reduction
in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher
number of forwards.

### [14] [Performance Analysis of Zero-Forcing Beamforming Strategies for the Uplink of an MU-MIMO System with Multi-Antenna Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23921)
*João Paulo P. G. Marques,Catherine Rosenberg*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 评估OFDMA MU-MIMO上行链路中三种零迫波束成形策略的性能：CTR1（每用户启用最强数据流）、BD（每用户启用所有可能流）和CTRF（灵活流分配）。提出基于贪婪搜索的启发式算法，分析不同场景下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于功率管理要求，OFDMA系统的上行链路无线资源管理必须在整个时隙内进行，这带来了挑战。需要评估不同波束成形策略在实际场景中的性能差异。

Method: 提出基于贪婪上行搜索的启发式算法，用于寻找可行的流集合。该算法在整个时隙上运行，考虑公平性、实际调制编码方案和所有无线资源管理过程。

Result: 在农村宏蜂窝场景中，当用户数较少时BD可替代更复杂的CTRF，用户数较多时CTR1可替代CTRF；在城市宏蜂窝场景中，CTR1因性能相似可替代CTRF。BD性能在简单功率管理方案下受损更严重。

Conclusion: 系统参数显著影响零迫策略性能，BD对功率管理方案更敏感。在不同场景下，可根据用户数量选择合适的简化策略替代复杂的CTRF方案。

Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the uplink of
OFDMA-based MU-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, for three Zero-Forcing
(ZF) Beamforming (BF) strategies: Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-1 (CTR1), where
only the strongest data stream is enabled per scheduled user; Block
Diagonalization (BD), where all possible streams are enabled per scheduled
user; Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-Flexible (CTRF), which allows a flexible
stream allocation per user. The Radio Resource Management (RRM) of the uplink
of all OFDMA-based systems must be done over an entire Time-Slot (TS) due to
power management, making it challenging. To enable this study, we propose an
efficient heuristic based on greedy-up searches for stream-sets that provides
feasible solutions. It operates over the TS and considers fairness, practical
Modulation and Coding Schemes and all RRM processes. The results show that, for
Rural Macro scenarios, BD (resp. CTR1) could replace the more complex CTRF if
the number of users is small (resp. large), while for Urban Macro scenarios,
CTR1 emerges as an alternative to CTRF due to its similar performance. We also
show that the system parameters can substantially impact the performance of the
ZF strategies and that BD performance is more impaired with a simpler power

Abstract: Resilience in optical networks has traditionally relied on redundancy and
pre-planned recovery strategies, both of which assume a certain level of
disaster predictability. However, recent environmental changes such as climate
shifts, the evolution of communication services, and rising geopolitical risks
have increased the unpredictability of disasters, reducing the effectiveness of
conventional resilience approaches. To address this unpredictability, this
paper introduces the concept of agile resilience, which emphasizes dynamic
adaptability across multiple operators and layers. We identify key requirements
and challenges, and present enabling technologies for the realization of agile
resilience. Using a field-deployed transmission system, we demonstrate rapid
system characterization, optical path provisioning, and database migration
within six hours. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
enabling technologies and confirm the feasibility of agile resilience.

Conclusion: 所提出的6G RAN架构通过简化、自动化和安全增强，为未来网络提供了高效、灵活和安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The collaborative research project 6G-ANNA develops concepts for the 6G radio
access network (RAN) architecture and technology components. Previous RAN
generations have become inherently more complex and reach their limits in
handling foreseen future traffic demands with their diverse characteristics in
an efficient manner, e.g., for the use-case of mobile eXtended Reality (XR) on
a massive scale. One main objective of 6G is to regain both operational and
energy efficiency, i.e., by simplification and automation. To achieve this, in
this paper a flexible 6G RAN functional architecture and protocol stack as well
as implementation and deployment options are described. We outline how
performance is optimized by distributed Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
and distributed Carrier Aggregation (CA), and furthermore, how adaptiveness and
scalability is enabled by Cloud RAN and service orchestration. Finally, the
proposed zero-trust framework mitigates security risks in the described 6G RAN
architecture.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于自监督学习的网络事件相似性关联方法，使用对比学习在大量未标记网络状况数据上训练深度神经网络，实现网络故障的自动化关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务提供商需要监控网络以检测、分类和修复服务故障。当检测到事件时，确定类似事件是否在过去发生过或正在网络中其他地方发生很重要。由于网络规模庞大，手动关联这些事件不可行，因此需要自动化关联。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法进行基于相似性的网络状况关联。通过对比学习在大量未标记网络状况数据集上训练深度神经网络。

Result: 在真实网络监控数据上的实验表明该方法达到了高精度，证明对比学习是网络事件关联的有前景方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习为网络事件关联提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案，能够自动化处理大规模网络中的事件相似性分析。

Abstract: Internet service providers monitor their networks to detect, triage, and
remediate service impairments. When an incident is detected, it is important to
determine whether similar incidents have occurred in the past or are happening
concurrently elsewhere in the network. Manual correlation of such incidents is
infeasible due to the scale of the networks under observation, making automated
correlation a necessity. This paper presents a self-supervised learning method
for similarity-based correlation of network situations. Using this method, a
deep neural network is trained on a large unlabeled dataset of network
situations using contrastive learning. High precision achieved in experiments
on real-world network monitoring data suggests that contrastive learning is a
promising approach to network incident correlation.

Abstract: Edge computing brings computation near end users, enabling the provisioning
of novel use cases. To satisfy end-user requirements, the concept of edge
federation has recently emerged as a key mechanism for dynamic resources and
services sharing across edge systems managed by different administrative
domains. However, existing federation solutions often rely on pre-established
agreements and face significant limitations, including operational complexity,
delays caused by manual operations, high overhead costs, and dependence on
trusted third parties. In this context, blockchain can create dynamic
federation agreements that enable service providers to securely interact and
share services without prior trust.
  This article first describes the problem of edge federation, using the
standardized ETSI multi-access edge computing framework as a reference
architecture, and how it is being addressed. Then, it proposes a novel solution
using blockchain and smart contracts to enable distributed MEC systems to
dynamically negotiate and execute federation in a secure, automated, and
scalable manner. We validate our framework's feasibility through a performance
evaluation using a private Ethereum blockchain, built on the open-source
Hyperledger Besu platform. The testbed includes a large number of MEC systems
and compares two blockchain consensus algorithms. Experimental results
demonstrate that our solution automates the entire federation lifecycle-from
negotiation to deployment-with a quantifiable overhead, achieving federation in
approximately 18 seconds in a baseline scenario. The framework scales
efficiently in concurrent request scenarios, where multiple MEC systems
initiate federation requests simultaneously. This approach provides a promising
direction for addressing the complexities of dynamic, multi-domain federations
across the edge-to-cloud continuum.

scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are
discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated
emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.

*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode是一种用于评估大语言模型数学推理能力的动态诊断方法，通过正弦驱动参数变化并分析模型输出的频率响应，提供增益和相位等可解释指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示模型在数学推理中的系统性问题，需要更精细的动态诊断方法来测量推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一次谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率分辨指标。

Result: 在五个闭式问题族中，诊断揭示了系统性的低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些是准确率评估无法发现的。结果将前沿模型与中端模型在动态性能上区分开来。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，通过可操作的推理保真度和一致性测量来补充标准基准测试，有助于进一步研究和采用。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，在特定领域有改进但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 引入AdaVaR两阶段自适应视觉推理学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过精心设计的AdaGRPO算法的强化学习过程诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域的应用日益广泛，理解其潜在的病态决策模式具有实际意义。

Method: 通过老虎机实验分析LLM决策行为，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析。

Result: 在老虎机实验中识别出人类赌博成瘾的认知特征，自主设定目标金额和投注大小时破产率显著上升，神经分析显示模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化人类认知偏差和决策机制，超越单纯模仿训练数据模式，强调了金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的智能框架，通过集成通用LLM、专用证明LLM、形式验证器和定理检索器，显著提升了数学问题的形式化证明能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专用证明LLM在形式化语言中解决的问题数量远少于通用LLM在自然语言中解决的问题，存在推理能力与验证准确性之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题拆分为子目标，使用证明LLM或推理LLM分别解决，并利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题（70.0%），比SeedProver（50.4%）显著提升。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理与形式化证明生成之间的差距，实现了推理能力与验证准确性的有机结合。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM机制发现可推广性的框架，包含五个对应轴，并通过分析Pythia模型中的1-back注意力头来验证该框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来确定一个模型中的发现何时以及如何推广到其他模型，这构成了基本认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴（功能、发展、位置、关系和配置），并实证分析Pythia模型不同规模（14M-410M）和随机种子中1-back注意力头的发展轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力在不同模型中的发展轨迹具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；更大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早出现、更陡峭斜率和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性映射到其涌现行为和机制。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLMs和问题嵌入到共享空间中，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，取代全局排名，支持平滑变化和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估实践将多样化能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维性质，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 提出JE-IRT框架，将LLMs和问题嵌入到共享几何空间中，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型和问题嵌入的几何交互决定。

Result: 实验结果显示：分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释；较大范数一致表示更难问题；新LLMs通过拟合单个嵌入即可加入；学习空间揭示了与人类定义类别部分对齐的LLM内部分类法。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一且可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备份助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼问题解决策略来动态提升弱模型性能，减少对昂贵模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本增加。需要一种能动态提升效率的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为可重用的通用问题解决策略，这些策略随后被添加到查询中，使弱模型在后续查询中动态提升性能。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和系统整体准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）并节省费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型展现出与人类相当的说服能力，但系统评估其说服能力具有挑战性，因为人类间的说服效果在不同领域差异很大。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类说服数据集构建评估和训练环境，并使用强化学习训练LLMs进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续实现高说服增益并展现符合理论预测的复杂说服策略；通过强化学习，即使是小模型也能获得显著更高的说服增益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展且原则性的框架来测量LLMs的说服能力，证明了强化学习在提升模型战略说服能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Motivation: 当前Agentic AI系统的评估方法主要关注识别适当代理、工具和参数的能力，但缺乏对任务与目标一致性的评估，存在关键空白。

Method: 开发创意对抗测试（CAT）框架，通过模拟Alexa+音频服务的合成交互数据进行广泛验证，保护用户隐私的同时全面测试边缘情况和故障模式。

Result: CAT框架提供了前所未有的任务-目标一致性洞察，能够更有效地优化和开发Agentic AI系统。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI系统评估的关键空白，为理解和改进任务与目标的一致性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Mafia基准测试，这是一个简化的四人社交推理游戏，用于评估大语言模型的社会智能和欺骗检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称性和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，是评估大语言模型社会智能的有用测试平台。

Method: 设计了简化版四人游戏（1个黑手党、1个侦探、2个村民），通过角色特定的获胜条件来隔离三种交互能力：欺骗、检测欺骗和有效披露信息。采用两阶段框架评估模型表现。

Result: 实验揭示了反直觉的结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型。还发现了涌现的多智能体动态，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅为基准测试提供了框架，还支持对多智能体动态的定量研究，并为AI安全生成欺骗检测训练数据。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Agentless训练方法产生技能先验，使SWE-Agent能高效适应，Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench上达到60.4%验证率，通过SFT适应后SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SWE解决方案分为多轮交互的SWE-Agent框架和单轮可验证步骤的Agentless方法，但这两者并非互斥。Agentless训练能产生技能先验，使SWE-Agent能更高效适应。

Method: 首先策划Agentless训练方法，开发开源SWE LLM Kimi-Dev，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行SFT适应，将Kimi-Dev应用于SWE-Agent。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中最佳表现。经过SFT适应后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet（241022版本）相当。

Conclusion: 来自Agentless训练的结构化技能先验能够桥接工作流和代理框架，实现可迁移的编码代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同训练阶段LLM的风险偏好行为，发现指令微调模型符合标准效用模型，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型则偏离效用模型，且后训练是最有效的风险偏好调控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在不确定性决策中的风险特征，以及提示工程和对齐方法如何影响其风险行为，现有研究主要关注个性提示或多智能体交互，缺乏对后训练影响的研究。

Method: 提出基于行为经济学和金融学工具的新流程，使用效用理论模型比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调控策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用公式一致的行为，预训练和RLHF对齐模型偏离任何拟合的效用模型，后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调控。

Conclusion: 揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，证明后训练能有效调控风险偏好，为行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MNPO框架，将Nash学习从两人博弈扩展到多人博弈，解决了现有方法无法捕捉真实偏好非传递性和异质性复杂结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Bradley-Terry假设的奖励方法难以捕捉真实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性，而现有的Nash学习方法局限于两人博弈，存在单一对手偏差，无法充分建模复杂偏好结构。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n人博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。建立了多人设置下的Nash均衡，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂、非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究通过创建经典心理意象任务的新变体来评估大语言模型的复杂认知能力，发现最佳LLM在纯文本条件下表现优于人类平均水平，挑战了传统认为此类任务必须依赖视觉心理意象的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，大型语言模型在训练数据包含的任务和纯语言任务上表现最佳，这限制了我们对其新兴复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLM是否能够完成传统认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，在纯文本条件下测试多个最先进的LLM，同时测试100名人类受试者作为基线，并测试不同推理级别的模型。

Result: 最佳LLM的表现显著高于人类平均水平，当模型分配更多推理token时表现最强，表明LLM可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLM在执行新任务时的新兴认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成传统认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [35] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型的注意力机制，减少幻觉并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖直接拼接图像和文本token，导致跨模态语义相关token之间距离过远，引起幻觉和性能下降

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标

Result: 在15个指标中的13个取得改进，推理任务提升32%，幻觉基准提升15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token分组有效提升视觉语言模型性能，是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Motivation: 利用LLM在传感器丰富的工业环境中实现自主健康监测，直接从传感器数据检测和分类故障，同时通过自然语言推理产生可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估了LLM系统架构(单LLM vs 多LLM)、输入表示(原始数据 vs 描述性统计)和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供统计摘要输入时表现最佳，多LLM系统使用专门提示在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的灵敏度。LLM能生成详细且人类可读的决策理由，但在持续学习环境中适应能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM基系统作为复杂环境中透明、自适应诊断工具具有前景，但在持续学习校准预测方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架为无线信道接入提供了根本性改进，在保持兼容性的同时提升了密集部署下的性能和公平性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA

industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定和验证大型复杂计算机系统至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI处理真实系统组件的能力。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变式正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件，如Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等，并正在积极添加更多组件。

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限，为该领域工具提供坚实基础，并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调的基本热力学约束，解释为什么协调需要信息损失，以及为什么在复杂系统中会出现持续亚稳态、滞后现象和相变。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度，引入协调温度概念来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度呈超线性增长(L(P)≥NKlog₂K+N²d²log(1/ε))，协调需要激进的信息损失，系统会形成持续亚稳态直到环境剧变触发相变。

Conclusion: 协调本质上需要信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中对齐伪造现象，为理解复杂系统中的协调动力学提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to
theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number
of reasoning steps is between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ for a model with
$L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多令牌预测(MTP)范式如何帮助大语言模型学习传递关系，提出了两种策略来增强传递层和学习质量，并通过实验验证了这些改进能显著提升模型的路径规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂规划任务中难以学习传递关系，这是复杂规划的基础。为了解决这个问题，研究者探索了多令牌预测范式对传递关系学习的影响。

Method: 使用包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出了两种增强策略：下一令牌注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层。在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 分析发现传递层逐渐学习多步邻接信息，使骨干模型能够捕捉训练数据中未直接观察到的传递可达关系。改进策略显著增强了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer在复杂规划任务中学习机制的理解，提供了克服传递性瓶颈的实用策略，为构建结构感知的通用规划模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练且能有效利用大语言模型推理能力的新方法。

Method: 结合在线探索性景观分析模块和多LLM推理链，通过实时定量反馈和自适应策略生成来实现零样本超参数控制。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为p-less的无超参数采样方法，基于信息论动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受生成任务和温度配置影响，需要一种更稳定、无需调参的采样策略。

Method: p-less采样：基于整个token概率分布的信息论方法，在每个解码步骤动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样一致优于现有方法，在高温下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效、高效且无需超参数的解码策略，在多种任务中表现优异，特别适合高温生成场景。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)的设计空间，提出混合数据合成框架和感知聚焦监督方法，在五个多模态基准测试中验证了VL-PRMs在提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)主要依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要探索更有效的VL-PRMs设计方法。

Method: 1) 提出混合数据合成框架，结合MCTS和强VLM判断生成更准确的步骤级标签；2) 引入感知聚焦监督，使PRM能够显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 实验表明：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现优于过程步骤选择；小VL-PRMs在检测过程错误方面可匹配或超越大模型；VL-PRMs能发掘强VLM骨干的潜在推理能力；感知级监督带来显著性能提升；不同策略在高级数学推理数据集上均有改进。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，混合数据合成和感知聚焦监督是关键创新，为VLM的进一步发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

TL;DR: GUI-PRA是一个专为GUI任务设计的流程奖励代理，通过动态记忆机制和自适应UI感知来解决标准流程奖励模型在GUI领域中的"中间迷失"问题和缺乏UI变化感知的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准流程奖励模型在处理密集人工输入和长历史数据时存在"中间迷失"现象，且缺乏GUI变化感知能力，无法适应GUI任务的动态特性。

Method: 提出GUI-PRA，包含：1) 动态记忆机制（基于相关性的检索模块和渐进式摘要模块）来对抗"中间迷失"；2) 自适应UI感知机制，通过推理UI状态变化并动态选择工具来收集视觉证据。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更有效地提供流程奖励，通过智能处理历史上下文和主动感知UI状态变化，提升了GUI代理在长时程任务中的表现。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过创新的动态记忆和UI感知机制，显著改善了GUI任务中流程奖励模型的性能，为GUI代理的自动化任务执行提供了更可靠的指导。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Motivation: 研究现代社会经济系统与人工智能技术深度融合背景下，AI协作在资源约束条件下对社会总产出的影响机制。

Method: 构建五个逐步扩展的异构多智能体模型：纯人类协作基准模型、引入AI协作模型、加入网络效应模型、独立生产者模型、以及整合网络效应和独立生产的综合模型。通过理论推导和模拟分析进行研究。

Result: AI智能体的引入显著增加了社会总产出；考虑智能体间网络效应时，产出增长呈非线性，远超个体贡献的简单加总；在相同资源投入下，将智能体视为独立生产者具有更高的长期增长潜力；引入网络效应进一步展现出显著的规模报酬递增特征。

Conclusion: AI协作在资源约束条件下能够有效提升社会总产出，特别是当考虑智能体间的网络效应和独立生产能力时，这种提升效应更加显著，呈现出非线性增长和规模报酬递增的特点。

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Method: 从信息熵角度分析工具调用对推理的影响，提出Tool-Light框架，包括数据集构建（连续自演化采样）和两阶段微调（SFT和自演化DPO）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型在执行工具集成推理任务时的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵引导的采样和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLMs在工具集成推理中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段框架，通过识别计算器和算法两种工具使用模式，并调整模式选择与教师偏好对齐，显著提升了工具集成推理在数学问题上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽视了如何应用工具。研究发现工具使用模式选择不当会导致推理失败，即使推理过程本身是正确的。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从计算器模式（使用代码直接计算）和算法模式（将问题编码为程序）构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐。

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上，模式感知方法显著提升了代码使用和准确性，例如在MATH500上Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，在AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对于工具集成推理非常有效，强调了工具应用方式选择的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建短路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: 提出Just-Enough Thinking (JET)方法：在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径；使用质量控制的长度奖励机制，在保持正确性的同时鼓励简洁推理。

Result: JET显著提升了推理效率且不牺牲准确性。DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥赛基准上准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性，为大型推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA是一个用于评估LLM代理在电子健康记录数据访问中端到端工作流程的基准测试，重点关注查询模糊性和术语不匹配问题，结果显示代理在一致性表现上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在电子健康记录数据访问中的部署受到限制，主要因为缺乏能够捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准测试，特别是查询模糊性和用户术语与数据库条目不匹配的问题。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA交互式数据库问答基准，评估数据库代理的端到端工作流程：澄清用户问题、使用工具解决术语不匹配、生成正确SQL。通过两种交互流程评估：增量查询优化和自适应查询优化。

Result: 实验显示，最先进的LLM代理在IncreQA上达到90-95%的Pass@5，在AdaptQA上达到60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验全部成功）要低35-60%，表明代理的一致性表现不足。

Conclusion: 需要构建不仅性能好而且鲁棒性强的代理，特别是在安全关键的电子健康记录领域。提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Motivation: 现有二进制代码相似性检测方法面临可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡：手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化能力强但不可解释且面临精度-可扩展性权衡。

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等人类可读的特征，这些特征可直接通过倒排或关系索引进行搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的召回率@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化TSP实例中识别有希望的小规模子问题，然后使用现成求解器高效优化这些子问题来改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有学习方法。在相同运行时间预算下，比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少12%到100%，特别是在超过10k节点的超大规模实例上表现更佳。

Conclusion: ViTSP为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

### [56] [GeoBS: Information-Theoretic Quantification of Geographic Bias in AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23482)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息理论框架GeoBS来评估地理偏见，该框架具有模型无关性和空间显式特性，能够公平比较不同AI模型的地理偏见并分析空间因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理偏见评估方法存在模型特定或空间隐式的问题，缺乏一个通用、可比较且能分析空间因素的地理偏见评估框架。

Method: 建立信息理论框架GeoBS，提出三种考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等复杂空间因素的新地理偏见评分方法。

Result: 在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上的实验表明，任务特定的GeoAI模型和通用基础模型都存在不同类型的地理偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Motivation: 解决教育不平等问题，通过开发可扩展的AI辅导系统，特别是针对数据稀疏环境下学生答题准确率预测的挑战。

Method: 基于项目反应理论的概率建模框架，结合主题级技能配置的协同过滤模型，以及新的离散变分推理方法。

Result: 实现了超过80%的数学考试预测准确率，在低数据设置下表现最佳，超越了所有传统IRT和矩阵分解基准方法。

Conclusion: 单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确率，新开发的离散变分推理框架在数据稀疏环境下表现优异，为AI辅导系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了容量熟悉度签名来表征LLM基准测试及其有意义的重叠，通过从真实语料中提取显著标记来探测基准性能所需的容量，发现编码是最不重叠的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解LLM基准测试之间的重叠关系，避免性能评估被基准无关因素（如问题格式）混淆，提供对基准有效性和LLM敏感性的机制性洞察。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，涵盖知识、编码、逻辑、指令遵循、数学、语言、推理和世界建模等多个领域。

Result: 性能重叠普遍较高，语义重叠局限于中等范围，而基准签名能有效捕捉变化、重叠和分歧。知识推理子任务有重叠，多语言文化基准相似度较低。编码是最不重叠的领域。

Conclusion: 基准签名对基准无关因素保持稳健，揭示了跨功能重叠（逻辑、数学、语言等），为理解LLM能力互联的底层景观提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文多臂老虎机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化指标来客观衡量人机信任关系，在三个数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化和客观的方法来测量人机信任校准，现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策过程，且缺乏跨情境的一致性指标。

Method: 使用上下文多臂老虎机这一自适应算法，结合上下文信息进行决策，开发动态信任校准指标来评估何时信任AI的贡献。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，有效的信任校准能显著提升决策性能，奖励指标提高了10%到38%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实践指导，特别是在疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM自身作为裁判来评估模型性能的方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，可以低成本替代传统的人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM模型不断发布，但参数数量并不能准确反映性能，需要独立评估方法。传统Elo评分需要人类参与，成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM作为裁判来评判模型之间的对决，通过统计LLM选择某个模型为最佳的一致率来生成评估指标。

Result: 该方法生成的指标与人类评估的Elo分数相关性达到91%，可以作为Elo分数的廉价代理指标。

Conclusion: LLM自我评估方法能够有效替代昂贵的人工评估，提供低成本、无需人类数据和先验知识的模型性能评估方案。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: 多轮多智能体编排通过让多个LLM智能体通过迭代提议答案或投票达成共识，在三个基准测试中匹配或超越了最强单模型性能。消融实验显示揭示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会加剧从众效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的关键因素。

Method: 使用四个LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：比较编排与单模型基线性能，并在GPQA-Diamond上进行消融实验，研究作者身份可见性和实时投票可见性的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越了最强单模型，并始终优于其他模型。最佳可达到的编排性能显示还有进一步提升空间。消融实验表明揭示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会加剧从众效应，加速收敛但有时会导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多轮多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，但需要注意避免从众效应和过早共识的问题，未来还有进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击，攻击者通过精心设计的提示使模型偏离人类价值观。

Method: 使用强化学习将越狱提示转化为形式化描述，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入来强化攻击。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，增强越狱攻击的隐蔽性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

TL;DR: 提出TCM-HEDPR模型，通过知识图谱扩散引导增强中医处方推荐，解决个性化信息不足、草药长尾分布和配伍关系忽略等问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐研究主要关注症状-草药关系，但存在三个主要限制：(1)缺乏对患者个性化信息的关注；(2)草药数据的长尾分布问题；(3)忽略中药'君臣佐使'配伍原则，影响疗效和安全性。

Method: 采用分层结构增强的个性化推荐模型：预训练症状表示并使用患者个性化提示序列；应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；使用知识图谱引导的同构图扩散方法结合自注意力机制；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系。

Result: 在2个公共数据集和1个临床数据集上的广泛实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行综合评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更准确地识别证候、提高疗效并降低毒副作用风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Result: 通过统一和严格比较不同方法，揭示了决定数据清洗在对齐任务中成功的关键因素。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐效果提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的关键但未被充分探索的作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的规划器在反应式闭环环境中难以有效引导，简单条件化在复杂动态驾驶场景中指导不足，而使用专家行为锚点的方法存在理论不一致性和性能问题。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive方法，采用锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供理论严谨的扩散框架，将锚点转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适应不同交通条件，兼容高效ODE求解器。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了理论严谨且高效的解决方案，能够有效利用专家行为锚点指导扩散模型，在复杂驾驶场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护系统存在两个根本性局限：对所有用户应用统一的防护策略，忽略了相同行为对不同用户的风险差异；仅检查单个响应，无法追踪跨多轮交互的风险累积。

Method: 首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态来创建个性化防护；其次在智能体流水线中实施持续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护、记忆守护等专门防护模块，追踪跨轮次风险累积并发出可验证裁决。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中，PSG-Agent显著优于包括LlamaGuard3和AGrail在内的现有智能体防护系统。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM智能体的个性化安全提供了一条可执行且可审计的路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Scaffolding框架，通过将推理过程抽象为离散语义信号序列来蒸馏LLMs的推理能力，而非简单地克隆文本，显著提升了小模型的推理准确性和逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从大语言模型蒸馏推理能力的方法（基于文本推理的行为克隆）存在根本性限制，只能让小模型模仿表面模式而非底层算法思维结构，导致逻辑鲁棒性不足。

Method: 首先将教师模型的思维过程抽象为离散可解释的语义信号序列（如对比、添加等）作为支架，然后通过多任务目标训练学生模型：（1）预测下一个语义信号以预判推理流程，（2）基于该信号生成相应推理步骤。

Result: 在一系列具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具备推理能力而非仅仅是流畅模仿的小型模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出统一理论解释RLVR训练中的奇特现象：模型推理过程映射为语义复杂网络的自组织，其拓扑保持稀疏，平均度接近2。该拓扑驱动系统先进入最大挫折状态形成技能孤岛，然后进入急剧增长阶段。基于此提出Annealed-RLVR算法，在最大挫折点引入SFT加热步骤，实验证明优于标准RLVR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型RLVR训练中出现的两阶段学习曲线、V形响应长度轨迹和灾难性遗忘等令人困惑的行为，为这些看似不同的现象提供统一的理论解释。

Method: 提出语义复杂网络自组织理论，认为模型推理过程映射为拓扑保持稀疏的复杂网络。基于该理论设计Annealed-RLVR算法，在最大挫折点引入基于SFT的加热步骤来解决竞争瓶颈。

Result: 在1.5B参数模型上的实验表明，Annealed-RLVR在分布内和分布外基准测试中均优于标准RLVR方法。

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新构建为可预测的结构自组织过程，为未来AI系统涌现推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,

### [71] [From Reasoning to Answer: Empirical, Attention-Based and Mechanistic Insights into Distilled DeepSeek R1 Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23676)
*Jue Zhang,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过三阶段分析发现，大型推理模型中的显式推理痕迹对答案生成具有重要影响，答案token会显著关注推理token，且对关键推理token的扰动会可靠地改变最终答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型推理模型中显式推理痕迹对答案生成的影响程度，明确推理与答案生成之间的相互作用机制。

Method: 使用三个蒸馏的DeepSeek R1模型，进行实证评估、注意力分析和机制干预（激活修补），分析推理token与答案token之间的关系。

Result: 包含显式推理能持续提高答案质量；答案token显著关注推理token；某些中间层推理焦点头能追踪推理轨迹；对关键推理token的扰动会改变最终答案。

Conclusion: 推理到答案存在定向和功能性的信息流，中间推理在塑造模型输出中发挥功能性作用。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

*Jianshuo Dong,Sheng Guo,Hao Wang,Zhuotao Liu,Tianwei Zhang,Ke Xu,Minlie Huang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化红队测试框架SafeSearch，用于评估基于LLM的搜索代理在面对不可靠搜索结果时的安全漏洞，发现GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的攻击成功率高达90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索代理连接LLM与互联网，虽然能获取更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 提出了一个系统性、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队测试框架，构建了包含300个测试用例的SafeSearch基准，涵盖五类风险（如错误信息和间接提示注入），评估了三种代表性搜索代理架构和15个后端LLM。

Result: LLM-based搜索代理存在显著漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的攻击成功率高达90.5%。常见防御实践（如提醒提示）效果有限。

Conclusion: 该框架的价值在于促进更安全的代理开发透明度，强调了搜索代理安全评估的重要性。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

### [73] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的可靠激活程度，这限制了特征质量的全面评估。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活，从而评估特征敏感性。

Result: 许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似；平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，为机制可解释性研究提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedLA是一个基于大语言模型的逻辑驱动多智能体框架，通过构建显式逻辑树和基于三段论的多轮图引导讨论，提升复杂医学问题的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度逻辑不一致问题，需要更透明的推理过程。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提、结论）构建显式逻辑树，通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代精炼逻辑树，实现错误纠正和矛盾解决。

Result: 在MedDDx和标准医学QA任务上，MedLA持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线，在不同开源和商业LLM骨干网络上都能有效扩展，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedLA为可信赖的医学推理提供了一个可泛化的范式，通过逻辑驱动多智能体框架实现了透明推理和前提级对齐。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAPO是一种新的强化学习框架，通过多轮外部专家交互增强LLM推理能力，在数学推理基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果监督的强化学习方法存在探索效率低和奖励稀疏的问题，需要改进推理训练过程。

Method: 提出专家辅助策略优化(EAPO)，让策略自适应决定何时及如何咨询专家，获得更丰富的奖励信号和可靠的推理轨迹。

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025和AIMO 2025等数学推理基准上，EAPO平均比自探索模型提升5分，优于专家辅助工作流和专家蒸馏模型。

Conclusion: 通过外部专家辅助内部化专家知识，EAPO有效增强了LLM的内在推理能力，在独立解决问题时产生更好的推理路径和更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低代码和模板化代理开发平台的兴起，用户可以快速构建和编排智能代理系统，但这些系统很脆弱，目前缺乏系统识别其潜在故障根因的方法。

Method: 构建AgentFail数据集（307个故障日志），使用反事实推理修复策略确保标注可靠性；开发故障根因分类法；建立基于LLM的自动根因识别基准测试。

Result: 分类法能显著提高性能，但根因识别的准确率最高仅为33.6%，表明该任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 本文为平台编排的智能代理系统提供了可靠的故障根因数据集、分类法和基准测试，为开发更可靠的智能代理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd是一个用于GUI任务的流程奖励模型，通过提供密集的逐步反馈来解决稀疏奖励和信用分配问题，显著提升了GUI代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI任务中稀疏奖励和难以处理的信用分配问题，这些因素阻碍了自主代理在长序列GUI任务中的表现。

Method: 开发GUI-Shepherd流程奖励模型，在包含52k交互的大规模数据集上训练，该数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的原理，可作为RL训练中的奖励提供者和推理中的验证器。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，通过多轮在线PPO将成功率提高了7.7个百分点，显著优于基于结果奖励模型的竞争对手；作为推理验证器带来5.1个百分点的改进。在AndroidControl基准测试中，作为奖励提供者提升2.2个百分点，作为验证器提升4.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 高保真度的流程监督对于构建更强大的GUI代理至关重要，并提供了一个可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型方法很少解释推荐反应条件的原理，限制了其在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知代理辩论和原理聚合四个步骤。

Result: 在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提高20-35%，比通用大语言模型提高10-15%，并提供可证伪、可信赖的原理解释。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多代理系统提供基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释推荐。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: FalconEye有潜力成为MLLMs的实用安全审计工具，填补了多模态大语言模型安全评估的空白。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support
the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard是一个用于自主AI系统运行时验证的框架，通过动态概率保证提供连续定量保证，将代理的原始I/O抽象为状态模型转换的形式事件，并使用在线学习构建和更新MDP模型进行实时概率验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速演进带来了显著风险，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使传统验证方法不足，需要转向概率保证，关注系统在给定约束下失败的概率而非是否失败。

Method: 作为检查层观察代理的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)来形式化建模代理的涌现行为，并通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。

Result: 提出了Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance新范式，能够为自主AI系统提供连续、定量的运行时保证。

Conclusion: AgentGuard框架通过动态概率保证方法有效解决了自主AI系统验证的挑战，为这类系统的安全可靠运行提供了新的验证途径。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效缓解梯度耦合问题，提高训练效果。

Conclusion: 通过分类好坏动作的方法可以有效解决基于结果奖励中的梯度耦合问题，提升自主智能体的训练性能。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Motivation: 虽然神经网络纤维化已被引入作为结合神经网络学习和推理的神经符号框架，但其与模态逻辑纤维化的确切对应关系从未被正式建立。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过形式化与纤维化神经网络兼容的纤维模型概念，建立神经网络纤维化与模态逻辑纤维化之间的对应关系。

Result: 成功建立了神经网络纤维化与模态逻辑纤维化之间的形式化对应，并推导出了GNN、GAT和Transformer编码器的非均匀逻辑表达能力结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用纤维化作为形式化工具来解释神经网络学习的逻辑理论开辟了道路，将计算逻辑工具应用于神经网络解释。

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: 提出了CANON方法，通过无方向性优势估计增强目标指标的影响，在数学推理和复杂逻辑任务中优于现有方法，同时提高token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通过奖励或优势塑造引入先验知识，但需要精心调整超参数，且方向性先验可能过于偏颇导致失败。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标高低分组，通过组间比较衡量哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在同组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上持续优于先前方法，应用于响应长度时进一步改善token效率，在性能-成本权衡中获得更优Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: CANON方法有效放大了目标指标的影响而不预设其方向，在推理能力和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

<details>

Motivation: 系统文献综述中搜索、筛选和分析科学文献是耗时任务，需要自动化工具来减少人工工作量，特别是自动论文选择可以显著提高识别相关文献的效率。

Method: 使用语法引导遗传编程构建可解释的基于规则的分类器，通过语法定义规则结构和语法，能够结合文本信息和文献计量数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成准确的分类器，同时保持可解释性，并支持现有方法未考虑的可配置信息源。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可解释性的前提下实现了准确的文献筛选，扩展了可用的信息源类型，为系统文献综述提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Conclusion: TusoAI能够自主开发优化计算方法，加速科学发现并揭示新生物学见解

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Alistair-Turcan/TusoAI.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，研究发现至少需要2次重复运行才能显著提高模型比较的稳定性，83%的排名会在单次运行中发生反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复运行才能得出可靠结论尚不明确，这影响了模型比较的可信度。

Method: 在AI4Math基准上对8个最先进模型进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估。

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次成对排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转；平均运行次数可适度缩小标准误（约5%）。

Conclusion: 建议将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这些实践能提高鲁棒性且对小团队可行，使模型比较更符合实际可靠性。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO是一种鲁棒偏好优化方法，通过EM算法推断标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解噪声，将现有对齐算法转化为鲁棒版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人类偏好对齐方法假设人类偏好是同质且无噪声的，但实际上人类偏好是多元的且标注者会犯错，导致数据与真实偏好存在差异，影响模型性能。

Method: 使用期望最大化算法推断标签正确性后验概率，自适应重加权训练数据点，建立偏好损失与概率模型的理论联系，将现有对齐算法系统转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架显著提升了四种先进对齐算法的性能，在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard的胜率分别提升高达7.0%和5.4%。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一个有效的元框架来增强偏好对齐算法的鲁棒性，理论上证明在完美校准模型下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

### [98] [Humanline: Online Alignment as Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24207)
*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在线对齐方法（如GRPO）比离线对齐方法（如DPO）性能更好，原因在于在线策略采样更好地模拟了人类对模型输出的感知分布，而PPO/GRPO的裁剪机制则反映了人类对概率的感知偏差。作者提出了一种将人类概率感知偏差显式融入目标函数的设计模式，创建了humanline变体，这些变体即使使用离线数据也能达到在线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法比离线对齐方法性能更好，从行为经济学的角度提供人类中心化的解释，并寻找在不牺牲性能的前提下实现更快速、更便宜、更灵活的后训练方法。

Method: 基于前景理论，提出在线策略采样能更好地近似人类对模型输出分布的感知，PPO/GRPO的裁剪机制反映了人类对概率的感知偏差。提出一种设计模式，将人类对概率的感知偏差显式融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中，创建humanline变体。

Result: humanline变体即使使用离线非策略数据训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上达到与在线对应方法相同的性能水平。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身与最大化人类效用无关，通过选择性训练模拟人类感知的数据可以达到相同效果。提出的humanline方法为更高效、灵活的对齐训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个基于动作链的LLM多机器人协作规划框架，通过构建意图绑定的动作序列、主动验证、针对性修正和执行验证动作的循环过程，在保持任务成功率的同时将令牌消耗降低至SOTA方法的24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡问题：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法在团队规模和任务复杂性增加时计算成本过高。

Method: 提出动作链作为基本规划原语，采用四步循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列，2)主动验证冲突和可行性，3)通过针对性机制修正问题，4)执行验证动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan实现了可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗SOTA方法24%的令牌，并提出了全面的效率评估指标。

Conclusion: ELHPlan为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿，在适应性和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的推理深度自适应框架，通过潜在向量引导实现按需计算分配，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题思考不足。需要一种能根据问题复杂度自适应分配计算资源的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来决策停止或继续推理。采用Group Relative Policy Optimization作为奖励信号调节推理深度，结合课程学习和奖励工程实现计算分配与问题难度的关联。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配或更好的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder证明了通过潜在向量引导实现推理深度自适应的可行性，在不修改主干模型权重的情况下有效平衡了性能和计算成本。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 本文提出了语言模型融合的实证缩放定律，发现模型大小和专家数量之间存在紧凑的幂律关系，增益随专家数量增加而递减，为模型融合提供了可预测的规划方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏量化规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时的收益回报。

Method: 通过实证研究识别出模型大小和专家数量之间的幂律关系，分析了不同架构和方法（Average、TA、TIES、DARE）下的融合效果。

Result: 发现尺寸相关的基础性能随模型容量增加而降低，而融合增益随专家数量增加呈现明显的收益递减规律，该定律在领域内和跨领域都成立。

Conclusion: 这一缩放定律使模型融合从启发式实践转变为可计算、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成式AI提供了可预测的增益实现路径。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

TL;DR: 提出SpecExit框架，通过轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号，解决大型推理模型的过度思考问题，实现66%的生成长度减少和2.5倍端到端延迟加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要的长输出和高的端到端延迟，限制了实际部署。现有的提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入了检测开销，限制了延迟收益并影响跨问题的泛化性。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态的启发，提出SpecExit框架，使用轻量级草稿模型直接从隐藏状态预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟加速2.5倍，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态提供了有效的提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HCI系统主要关注非协作物理活动，而协作任务需要系统推断用户对队友意图的假设，这是一个模糊且动态的过程，需要可解释和可修正的表征。

Method: 将协作任务学习构建为程序合成问题，用可编辑程序表示行为，使用叙述演示（物理动作+自然语言）作为统一的教学、检查和修正模式。

Result: 在20名用户教授多人足球战术的研究中，70%成功精炼学习程序以匹配其意图，90%认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中支持用户教学的独特挑战，并提出了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有图推理方法和基准测试的问题，发现基础模型因推理重点不当而被低估。通过将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，基础模型能轻松解决现有基准中的大多数图推理任务。作者构建了更具挑战性的GraphAlgorithm基准，并提出了Simple-RTC方法，在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，并在新基准上显著优于所有先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在图推理任务中表现不佳，作者认为这是由于现有方法和基准测试存在问题，导致基础模型的潜力被低估。需要重新思考LLMs在图推理中的发展方向。

Method: 提出了Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)方法，引导LLMs先设计图算法，然后通过编码来解决图推理任务。同时构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准测试中达到近乎完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过改变推理重点，基础模型在图推理任务中具有巨大潜力。Simple-RTC为未来LLMs在图推理领域的发展提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架(RS-GRPO)，解决RLVR在LLMs推理任务中的探索困境，通过风险寻求目标在保持单解准确率的同时提升多解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLMs的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法，导致解决方案多样性不足，抑制了多解性能(pass@k)，只能提炼现有能力而非发现新推理策略。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习框架，使用在均值和最大奖励间插值的风险寻求目标，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动更深层探索。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和五种不同LLMs上，RS-GRPO持续改进pass@k性能，同时保持或提升pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO是简单易实现的解决方案，仅需少量代码修改即可有效解决RLVR的探索困境，在保持单解性能的同时显著提升多解性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，通过动态自我纠正机制解决了思维链推理中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一图与语言基础模型，有效解决了现有图增强RAG方法的局限性，在知识密集型推理任务中表现出色，具有良好的可扩展性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统评估，又为增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性提供了实用途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

TL;DR: MedMMV是一个可控的多模态多智能体框架，通过多样化短轨迹、结构化证据图和幻觉检测器来稳定临床推理，提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在医疗基准测试中表现出有希望的性能，但存在早期证据解释不稳定的关键失败模式，导致幻觉和全局不一致的结论，需要约束随机性和幻觉的临床推理智能体。

Method: MedMMV通过多样化短轨迹稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准测试中，MedMMV将准确性提高了高达12.7%，并表现出更优越的可靠性。盲法医师评估证实MedMMV显著提高了推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域（如临床决策支持）部署可信赖AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinTech行业的技术突破提升了用户参与度，但LLM微调可能产生不专业的言论，且缺乏领域特定数据集，现有研究只关注孤立组件。

Method: 引入Fin-Vault数据集（1,417个标注多轮对话）和Fin-Ally模型，集成COMET-BART常识上下文，使用DPO优化生成人类对齐的响应。

Result: 结合常识上下文使语言模型能生成更精细、文本精确且专业基础的金融指导，超越了基本账户管理，提供个性化预算、实时支出跟踪和自动财务规划。

Conclusion: 该方法通过常识推理和人类对齐优化，为FinTech领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，能生成更专业和可信的金融建议。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: 提出了自适应蒙特卡洛搜索(AMCS)框架，通过动态调整节点值估计和路径扩展策略，提高了过程奖励模型(PRM)训练数据的生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且不灵活。

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计上自适应分配采样资源，对不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；在路径扩展上采用时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法，从广泛探索逐步转向最有希望方向的利用。

Result: 构建了包含20万过程监督样本的MathSearch-200K数据集。Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，超越所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下性能超过72B模型。

Conclusion: AMCS方法显著提升了过程奖励模型的训练效率和性能，在分布外问题上也表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM框架，将数学推理分为策略规划和目标执行两个阶段，通过自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法，在多个数学推理基准上优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，但单一策略无法适应问题特定需求，且在效果和效率之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，训练轻量级策略适配器获取四种推理策略的置信度分布，在推理时根据置信度动态选择单策略执行、双策略验证或多策略探索。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM相比单一策略和集成基线有0.9%到7.6%的提升，自适应路由方法在不同模型架构上都表现出色。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过自适应策略选择有效解决了数学推理中效果与效率的权衡问题，在不同模型架构上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 本文提出IPO方法，通过干预式偏好优化来对齐大型推理模型的安全推理过程，解决现有方法忽视推理过程安全性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些有害推理仍可能被恶意用户利用。现有方法忽视了安全推理的重要性，影响了模型的可信度。

Method: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过将合规步骤替换为安全触发器，并构建具有强信号的偏好学习对，来强制实施安全推理。

Result: 在越狱和对抗性安全基准测试中，IPO显著提高了推理和响应的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线方法，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在各种推理任务上保持优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了显式对齐推理过程的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域的泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出以思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性为中心的数据标注和训练框架，将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关逻辑流程。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的九个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）中通过加权多数投票实现了6.5%的平均准确率提升，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，证明了建模逻辑流程而非领域知识对提升PRM泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Motivation: 解决约束获取中被动方法容易过拟合（学习到虚假全局约束）而纯主动方法查询成本高的问题，特别是在数据有限场景下。

Method: 混合框架：1) 被动学习生成候选约束；2) 基于概率置信度的交互式精炼识别过拟合；3) 子集探索机制恢复有效子结构；4) 主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型精度至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,

prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Method: EvoPH框架整合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，通过性能反馈共同进化提示和启发式算法，模拟多样化的启发式种群。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解获得了最低的相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展，能够有效避免局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast

accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决直接处理XML格式在BPMN图创建和编辑中的准确性问题，提出使用结构化的JSON表示法来增强流程修改的可靠性。

Method: 引入专门的基于JSON的结构化表示法，使用图编辑距离(GED)和相对图编辑距离(RGED)评估生成质量，使用二元成功指标评估编辑性能。

Result: JSON和XML在生成相似度得分上相近，但JSON提供更高的可靠性、更快的处理速度和显著更高的编辑成功率。

Conclusion: JSON表示法在BPMN图处理中比XML更可靠高效，未来将继续改进工具性能。

Abstract: This paper presents BPMN Assistant, a tool that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for natural language-based creation and editing of BPMN diagrams.
A specialized JSON-based representation is introduced as a structured
alternative to the direct handling of XML to enhance the accuracy of process
modifications. Process generation quality is evaluated using Graph Edit
Distance (GED) and Relative Graph Edit Distance (RGED), while editing
performance is evaluated with a binary success metric. Results show that JSON
and XML achieve similar similarity scores in generation, but JSON offers
greater reliability, faster processing, and significantly higher editing
success rates. We discuss key trade-offs, limitations, and future improvements.

TL;DR: 提出一种直观的人机教学架构，通过少量示例让人类教AI系统执行主观任务，在食材替换任务中仅需100个示例就能达到完整训练集一半的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从少量示例快速学习新概念，但AI系统在这方面仍有挑战，特别是在数据稀缺的主观任务中需要重现这种能力。

Method: 构建人机教学架构，人类通过提供演示示例来教导代理；利用领域知识扩展代理的任务理解；采用学习方法来高效学习有限示例；优化人类选择最具代表性且冗余度低的示例。

Result: 在食材替换任务中，代理仅需100个示例就能达到完整训练集（50k示例）一半的任务性能，相比传统方法更高效。

Conclusion: 通过策略性示例排序和利用外部符号知识的学习方法，代理能够更有效地进行泛化，实现从少量示例中高效学习主观任务。

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使通信能实现协调，也不一定意味着真正的理解。在信号游戏中，代理可能发展出"成功的误解"——使用不同解释但能协调。这种误解难以发现和修复，且无法扩展到新伙伴。至少三个代理相互交互是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设：协调是否意味着理解。探索在缺乏共同观察的环境中，代理如何发展通信词汇，特别是人类和人工智能混合群体中的通信涌现问题。

Method: 使用信号游戏框架，代理在没有共同观察的情况下发展新信号词汇，仅通过通信信号和交互结果（奖励）来协调。代理开发信号、使用信号并改进解释，但不观察其他代理如何使用信号。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时代理对信号的解释和使用方式不同，形成"成功的误解"。使用不对齐解释的代理无法与新伙伴建立成功协调。至少三个代理相互交互是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。

Conclusion: 协调不一定意味着理解，可能存在"成功的误解"。为确保真正共享解释的出现，需要至少三个代理相互交互，这种设置能补偿信号使用缺乏共同观察的不足。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在遇到困难问题时会产生无效推理，浪费计算资源且给出错误答案，需要探索模型是否具有自我认知边界的能力。

Method: 通过分析推理表达中的置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现模型能够识别可解与不可解问题，并提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种优化策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略能够在不牺牲准确性的情况下避免无效推理，显著提高可靠性和效率，减少token使用量达62.7-93.6%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具有自我认知边界的能力，通过简单的监控策略可以有效避免无效推理，提高模型效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Result: 在Things-EEG数据集上显著优于现有EEG解码方法

Conclusion: 图学习与对比目标的结合为EEG脑解码提供了变革性潜力，有助于更通用和鲁棒的神经表征

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，导致方法难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场等人类推理核心的挑战性场景。

Method: LogicAgent框架基于符号学方阵指导，在一阶逻辑中执行多视角演绎，通过包含三值决策方案的存在导入检查来避免空泛推理，更忠实地处理边界情况。

Result: 在RepublicQA基准上达到最先进性能，平均提升6.25%，在主流逻辑推理基准上平均提升7.05%，证明该方法能有效提升LLMs的逻辑性能。

Conclusion: 基于符号学的多视角推理在提升LLMs逻辑性能方面具有强大有效性，RepublicQA基准为评估逻辑推理提供了语义最丰富的资源。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

TL;DR: 提出查询电路方法，直接在模型内部追踪特定输入到输出的信息流，相比现有方法能更忠实解释模型对具体查询的响应原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更本地化、输入级别的解释方法。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，并采用基于采样的方法来高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试(IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC)中发现，模型内部存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%的连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为忠实、可扩展地解释语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。作者认为LLM的逻辑推理性能同时受训练数据潜力和模型认知能力的约束。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合逻辑结构进行分析。基于此提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其更好地与LLM的逻辑推理边界对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在性能和泛化能力上显著优于以数据为中心的策略。在强化学习框架下的验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 相比单纯增加数据规模或改变表面形式，优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

*Max Pellert,Clemens M. Lechner,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID方法利用大语言模型嵌入有效恢复心理测量问卷的潜在维度结构，无需领域特定微调即可获得维度间负相关，解释55%的人类数据方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索语义嵌入能否有效复制通过广泛人类调查建立的心理测量结构。

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，比较多种嵌入模型在多个评估指标上的表现，验证其在修订版肖像价值问卷上的效果。

Result: 嵌入方法解释55%的维度相似性方差，多维标度配置显示良好的因子一致性系数，与基础理论基本一致。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，同时保持与传统方法相当的质量。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Motivation: 解决规范性理论与任务驱动理论难以定量仲裁竞争理论，以及难以作为归纳偏置改进真实生物数据集拟合的问题

Method: 使用自适应深度核高斯过程，在规范性理论生成的合成数据上进行元学习，获得理论信息核来指定概率模型

Conclusion: 为神经科学及其他领域提供了更通用、可扩展和自动化的方法，将理论知识集成到数据驱动的科学探究中

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估方法的空白，为评估和改进法律多智能体系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: 本文对V2X协同感知系统进行了实证研究，识别了6种常见错误模式，评估了关键组件的影响，发现LiDAR协同性能最佳、V2I/V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同、协同感知错误会增加驾驶违规频率、系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知的远距离物体检测和遮挡问题，但由于传感器类型多样、协同智能体多变、融合方案不同以及通信条件差异，系统复杂性带来了诸多运行挑战，且错误预测的类型和原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，识别并分析了协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，系统评估了关键组件对感知性能的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V通信在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加会导致驾驶违规频率升高；(4) 在线运行时系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望研究结果能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Motivation: 科学发现过程需要观察、分析和假设生成的循环，目前机器学习方法难以完全自动化这一开放式的探索过程，特别是在未知系统中无需任务特定指导的情况下。

Method: 利用大型语言模型的工具使用能力，通过代码执行等基础工具，让智能体自由探索物理系统，包括机械动力学系统、波演化系统和量子多体物理系统。

Conclusion: 这种设置的有效性为在其他领域进行类似科学探索打开了大门，无需微调或任务特定指令。

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

TL;DR: CLPO是一种基于课程学习的强化学习算法，通过动态难度评估和自适应问题重构，让LLM在策略优化过程中实现自我教学，显著提升推理能力训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型能力之间的差异，导致对已掌握问题的无效探索和对挑战性问题缺乏有效指导，限制了学习效率和性能上限。

Method: CLPO利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型作为自己的老师：多样化中等难度问题以促进泛化，简化挑战性问题使其更易达成。

Result: 在8个数学和通用推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均pass@1提升6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同进化的动态过程，证明了更高效训练更强大推理模型的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay是一个可扩展的任务生成管道，通过探索交互环境来合成多样、可执行且可验证的任务，用于训练多模态大语言模型代理，显著减少对人类标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示MLLM生成任务，成本高昂且覆盖范围有限，需要一种可扩展的方法来生成高质量的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段让MLLM探索者代理系统性地发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指南提示作为上下文合成任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用上生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用上生成10k任务，训练出的UI代理在移动使用场景中成功率提升20.0%，在计算机使用场景中提升10.9%。结合强化学习还能额外获得5.7%的增益。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为训练能力强的MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的后训练方法，显著减少了对人类标注的依赖。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Conclusion: CEL展示了构建更通用、可解释智能体的路径，不仅有效行动，还通过显式推理构建透明且不断改进的世界模型。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,

hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA

Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中的真正作用：是教授新技能还是仅仅激活现有能力，以澄清RL在LLM学习中的价值。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合。

Result: 实验表明RL确实能让LLM学习函数组合的新技能，这种能力能泛化到更复杂的组合问题，并能迁移到不同任务中。

Conclusion: RL能促使LLMs获得真正的新技能，建议先构建具有基本技能的基座模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决能力。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成反馈进行对齐，但为了持续改进和多方面对齐，未来模型需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发两种互补方法：1）用户引导重写：根据用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意的模型输出；2）基于用户奖励：通过基于用户长期交互历史（称为persona）的奖励模型进行学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面均优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 有机人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本LLM视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕捉高级推理所需的抽象语义）。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述，利用基于文本的类比推理来增强导航代理的上下文理解。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明导航性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理，可以有效提升视觉语言导航代理的性能。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在需要串行视觉处理的任务上表现不佳，与人类存在显著差距，串行处理能力不足是VLMs的主要瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试上表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务上却不如人类，假设是缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力

Method: 通过三个领域（几何推理、感知枚举、心理旋转）设计不同串行处理需求的任务，比较人类和VLM表现，用人类反应时间作为串行处理负载的代理指标

Result: 所有领域都显示一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加强相关，任务串行处理需求越高，VLM与人类性能差距越大

Conclusion: 视觉基础的串行推理能力不足是当前VLMs与人类之间的根本区别，代表了模型的主要瓶颈

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniAPL是一个统一对抗偏好学习框架，通过单阶段训练同时利用监督微调和强化学习数据，解决传统SFT+RL流程中的分布不匹配问题，实现更好的模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT后接RL的对齐方法存在关键问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识变得脆弱；后续RL无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，造成效率低下和更新不接地气。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习，让密集专家演示直接规范和指导在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上，UniAPL匹配或超越了强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（达到32B模型水平），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超过了教师模型。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，输出更接近专家演示。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法在判断检测上表现不佳。

Method: 引入J-Detector，一个轻量级透明神经网络检测器，通过显式提取语言和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行准确检测。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，并验证了判断检测在现实场景中的实际效用。

Conclusion: LLM生成的判断是可检测的，J-Detector提供了一种有效方法来识别和量化LLM法官的偏见，在敏感应用场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of
all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper
investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using
hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of
individual data objects. We establish upper bounds on the sum of service rates
of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary
Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for
non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service
rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated
generator matrix.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了扩展有限状态维度的理论框架，研究多个有限状态智能体协同工作时的计算能力和维度特性，探索多头配置对序列复杂性的影响。

Method: 使用多头有限状态赌徒模型，其中多个有限状态智能体（头）以单向移动规则协同工作，领导者根据头报告的信息对无限数据流进行投注，通过赌注策略（gales）量化资本增长速率。

Result: 证明了多头有限状态维度随头数增加形成严格层次结构，给出了明确分离h头和h+1头有限状态赌徒盈利能力的序列族，发现多头有限状态维度在有限并集下稳定，但固定头数h>1的预维度缺乏此稳定性。

Conclusion: 多头有限状态维度为有限状态维度理论提供了有意义的推广，揭示了多头配置在序列复杂性分析中的重要作用，并建立了严格的层次分离结果。

Abstract: We introduce multihead finite-state dimension, a generalization of
finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with
oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time,
enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In
aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose
maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using
betting strategies called gales, determines the multihead finite-state
dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state
dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main
theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving
an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the
earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head
finite-state gamblers. We prove that multihead finite-state dimension is stable
under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number
$h>1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability
property.

TL;DR: 本文重新研究了zigzag阵列码，为其添加了小域大小和低跳过成本两个新特性，使得这种MDS码在理论和实践上都更加实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zigzag码虽然具有最优访问和最优重建比，但在实际应用中受到域大小依赖和跳过成本的限制。本文旨在解决这些问题，使zigzag码更适合现代分布式存储系统。

Method: 1) 使用特征为2的域和Z_2^m群结构，解耦参数依赖关系；2) 提出排序-子群框架，实现修复传输方案，同时保持最优访问和重建比。

Result: 构建了零跳过成本的码族（码率接近2/3）和有界跳过成本的码族（码率接近3/4和4/5），这些码率与实践中广泛部署的MDS阵列码相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明zigzag码可以在保持原有优势的同时，在理论上更加灵活，在实践中更加实用。

Abstract: We revisit zigzag array codes, a family of MDS codes known for achieving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio in single-node repair. In this
work, we endow zigzag codes with two new properties: small field size and low
skip cost. First, we prove that when the row-indexing group is $\mathcal{G} =
\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ and the field has characteristic two, explicit coefficients
over any field with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge N$ guarantee the MDS property, thereby
decoupling the dependence among $p$, $k$, and $M$. Second, we introduce an
ordering-and-subgroup framework that yields repair-by-transfer schemes with
bounded skip cost and low repair-fragmentation ratio (RFR), while preserving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio. Our explicit constructions include
families with zero skip cost whose rates approach $2/3$, and families with
bounded skip cost whose rates approach $3/4$ and $4/5$. These rates are
comparable to those of MDS array codes widely deployed in practice. Together,
these results demonstrate that zigzag codes can be made both more flexible in
theory and more practical for modern distributed storage systems.

*Yirun Wang,Yongqing Wang,Yuyao Shen,Gongpu Wang,Chintha Tellambura*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在单基站SISO系统中使用可重构智能表面(RIS)进行三维位置和速度联合估计(3D-JPVE)的方法，通过结合RIS部署和多快照利用解决了单RIS或多快照单独使用时的不可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基站锚点成本高，而RIS面板可作为经济高效的定位锚点。在单基站可用场景下，仅依靠单个RIS或多个快照无法实现3D-JPVE，需要结合两者来解决这一挑战。

Method: 开发了两阶段方法：1) 多快照信道参数估计：张量粗估计+最大似然精化；2) 3D-JPVE：通过差分测量的线性方程粗估计+原始测量的迭代精化。引入三阶张量分解将3D联合离开角和多普勒频移估计分解为两个可处理子问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明所提出的估计器具有统计效率，3D-JPVE方法接近Cramer-Rao下界精度。主动RIS相比被动RIS带来显著的3D-JPVE性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过RIS部署与多快照利用的结合，成功实现了单基站SISO系统中的3D-JPVE，所提出的低复杂度方法在统计效率和性能方面表现优异。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective
anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS)
anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity
estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one
BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when
relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this,
we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable
realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel
parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed
by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a
third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint
angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable
subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating
optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further
design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation
is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the
preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements.
Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that
the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results
confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate
substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to
passive RIS.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了RIS辅助的XL-MIMO下行系统，为近场和远场用户提供通信服务，提出了三种预编码方案和优化算法，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XL-MIMO系统中远场用户因遮挡而通信困难的问题，通过RIS辅助通信并优化预编码和相位设计来提升系统性能。

Method: 采用CZF、LZF和MRT三种预编码方案，提出启发式可见区域选择算法降低复杂度，设计两阶段相位偏移和功率控制算法优化加权最小频谱效率。

Result: 当近场和远场用户优先级相同时，相比等功率分配和随机相位设计，所提设计将加权最小频谱效率总和分别提升了31.9%(CZF)、37.8%(LZF)和119.2%(MRT)。

Conclusion: CZF性能最佳，LZF复杂度较低且性能相当；当优先考虑某类用户时，LZF对优先用户表现良好，而CZF能保证两类用户间的平衡性能。

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) downlink system, where an
XL-MIMO array serves two groups of single-antennas users, namely near-field
users (NFUEs) and far-field users (FFUEs). FFUEs are subject to blockage, and
their communication is facilitated through the RIS. We consider three precoding
schemes at the XL-MIMO array, namely central zero-forcing (CZF), local
zero-forcing (LZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Closed-form
expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users are derived for MRT
precoding, while statistical-form expressions are obtained for CZF and LZF
processing. A heuristic visibility region (VR) selection algorithm is also
introduced to help reduce the computational complexity of the precoding scheme.
Furthermore, we devise a two-stage phase shifts design and power control
algorithm to maximize the sum of weighted minimum SE of two groups of users
with CZF, LZF and MRT precoding schemes. The simulation results indicate that,
when equal priority is given to NFUEs and FFUEs, the proposed design improves
the sum of the weighted minimum SE by 31.9\%, 37.8\%, and 119.2\% with CZF,
LZF, and MRT, respectively, compared to the case with equal power allocation
and random phase shifts design. CZF achieves the best performance, while LZF
offers comparable results with lower complexity. When prioritizing NFUEs or
FFUEs, LZF achieves strong performance for the prioritized group, whereas CZF
ensures balanced performance between NFUEs and FFUEs.

Abstract: Status update systems require the timely collection of sensing information
for which deploying multiple sensors/servers to obtain diversity gains is
considered as a promising solution. In this work, we construct an absorbing
Markov chain (AMC) to exactly model Age of Information (AoI) in a discretetime
dual-queue (DTDQ) status update system with generate at will (GAW) status
updates, discrete phase-type (DPH-type) distributed service times and
transmission freezing. Specifically, transmission is frozen for a certain
number of slots following the initiation of a transmission, after which one of
the two servers is allowed to simultaneously sample the monitored physical
process and transmit a status update packet, according to the availabilities
and priorities of the two servers. Based on the discrete-time AMC, we provide
the exact distributions of both AoI and peak AoI (PAoI), enabling the
derivation of arbitrary order moments. In addition, we analytically study the
role of freezing using several typical service time distributions, including
geometric, uniform, and triangular distributions. The introduction of freezing
for DTDQ systems is demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in reducing the
mean AoI for various service time distributions. Additionally, we study the
impact of the statistical parameters of the service times and heterogeneity
between the two servers on the freezing gain, i.e., reduction in mean AoI
attained with optimum freezing policies.

Conclusion: 这种新的ND-NOMA设计使三个用户能够使用不同维度同时通信，为噪声域系统和物联网环境中的可扩展多用户通信铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel three-user noise-domain non-orthogonal
multiple access (ND-NOMA) scheme by introducing the correlation as a new
dimension besides mean and variance quantities used in two-user ND-NOMA. The
new three-user ND-NOMA scheme includes both uplink and downlink scenarios, with
detectors designed to decode the information embedded in mean, variance, and
correlation. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results under Rician
fading channels show that the proposed system is capable of achieving promising
bit error rate (BER) performance while preserving the low power and low
complexity advantages of ND-NOMA. This new ND-NOMA design enables simultaneous
communication among three users using different dimensions, paving the way for
scalable multi-user communication in noise-domain systems and in the
Internet-of-things (IoT) environments.

Conclusion: 通过零空间设计方法实现了分布式计算中任务分配和通信策略的联合优化，首次将通信成本与一般覆盖设计的覆盖数联系起来，为分布式计算提供了新的理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of distributed computation of linearly
separable functions, where a master node with access to $K$ datasets, employs
$N$ servers to compute $L$ user-requested functions, each defined over the
datasets. Servers are instructed to compute subfunctions of the datasets and
must communicate computed outputs to the user, who reconstructs the requested
outputs. The central challenge is to reduce the per-server computational load
and the communication cost from servers to the user, while ensuring recovery
for any possible set of $L$ demanded functions.
  We here establish the fundamental communication-computation tradeoffs for
arbitrary $K$ and $L$, through novel task-assignment and communication
strategies that, under the linear-encoding and no-subpacketization assumptions,
are proven to be either exactly optimal or within a factor of three from the
optimum. In contrast to prior approaches that relied on fixed assignments of
tasks -- either disjoint or cyclic assignments -- our key innovation is a
nullspace-based design that jointly governs task assignment and server
transmissions, ensuring exact decodability for all demands, and attaining
optimality over all assignment and delivery methods. To prove this optimality,
we here uncover a duality between nullspaces and sparse matrix factorizations,
enabling us to recast the distributed computing problem as an equivalent
factorization task and derive a sharp information-theoretic converse bound.
Building on this, we establish an additional converse that, for the first time,
links the communication cost to the covering number from the theory of general
covering designs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission
scheme to maximize the minimum achievable rate among ground users for emergency
communications in post-disaster scenarios with obstacles, with which the
optimal positioning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled base
stations can be achieved timely.To address the resulting non-convex and
intractable optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization
approach. Specifically, we relax obstacle-related constraints using penalty
terms. In each iteration, block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex
approximation (SCA) are applied alternately to obtain locally optimal
solutions, and penalty multipliers are updated to ensure convergence of the
relaxed problem to the original one. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the
minimum achievable rate, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: 该研究为DNA存储中的可靠数据恢复提供了理论支持和实用的编码方案。

Abstract: DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term
data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent
errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical
or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can
further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates
significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate
a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols
complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random
symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and
construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding

Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates
fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under
finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged
as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in
short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and
accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the
performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two
key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP).
Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based
on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy
compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results
validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the
superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed
antenna placement.

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the
development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The
changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical
Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented
paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting,
in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors,
communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two
classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics,
suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time
control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to
semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay
compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide
per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over
error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we
introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced
errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure
distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the
approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting
distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered
compression methods.

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to
enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to
achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible
mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization
more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To
address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for
stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on
this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base
station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs'
positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to
collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this
problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that
the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of
optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed
problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden
monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To
solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization
framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive
the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer
layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA
positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we
proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional
mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both
conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks

Conclusion: 提出的分裂交替算法是求解拼接正交矩阵线性系统稀疏解的有效方法，具有收敛性和计算效率优势。

Abstract: A class of splitting alternating algorithms is proposed for finding the
sparse solution of linear systems with concatenated orthogonal matrices.
Depending on the number of matrices concatenated, the proposed algorithms are
classified into the two-block splitting alternating algorithm (TSAA) and the
multi-block splitting alternating algorithm (MSAA). These algorithms aim to
decompose a large-scale linear system into two or more coupled subsystems, each
significantly smaller than the original system, and then combine the solutions
of these subsystems to produce the sparse solution of the original system. The
proposed algorithms only involve matrix-vector products and reduced orthogonal
projections. It turns out that the proposed algorithms are globally convergent
to the sparse solution of a linear system if the matrix (along with the
sparsity level of the solution) satisfies a coherence-type condition. Numerical
experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are very promising and can
quickly and accurately locate the sparse solution of a linear system with
significantly fewer iterations than several mainstream iterative methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on low-rank phase retrieval, which aims to
reconstruct a matrix $\mathbf{X}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ with ${\mathrm{
rank}}(\mathbf{X}_0)\le r$ from noise-corrupted amplitude measurements
$\mathbf{y}=|\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X}_0)|+\boldsymbol{\eta}$, where
$\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a linear map
and $\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the noise vector. We first examine
the rank-constrained nonlinear least-squares model $\hat{\mathbf{X}}\in
\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times
m},\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{X})\le
r}}\||\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X})|-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$ to estimate $\mathbf{X}_0$,
and demonstrate that the reconstruction error satisfies
$\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F,
\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim
\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ with high probability, provided
$\mathcal{A}$ is a Gaussian measurement ensemble and $p\gtrsim (m+n)r$. We also
prove that the error bound $\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ is tight
up to a constant. Furthermore, we relax the rank constraint to a nuclear-norm
constraint. Hence, we propose the Lasso model for low-rank phase retrieval,
i.e., the constrained nuclear-norm model and the unconstrained version. We also
establish comparable theoretical guarantees for these models. To achieve this,
we introduce a strong restricted isometry property (SRIP) for the linear map
$\mathcal{A}$, analogous to the strong RIP in phase retrieval. This work
provides a unified treatment that extends existing results in both phase
retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery from rank-one measurements.

the error probability of a simple bounded distance decoding (BDD) for BCH
codes. However, BDD falls short in many applications. In this work, we consider
error-and-erasure decoding and its variants that improve upon BDD. We derive
closed-form expressions for their error probabilities and validate them through
simulations. Then, we illustrate their use in assessing concatenated coding
schemes.

Abstract: This letter investigates the secrecy performance of wireless communication
systems assisted by a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS). Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed geometries,
FRISs dynamically select a subset of reflective elements based on real-time
channel conditions, offering enhanced spatial diversity and adaptability. Using
this foundation, we model a secure downlink scenario where a base station
communicates with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the
propagation is assisted by a FRIS with a limited number of elements set to the
ON state. We analyze the system's secrecy performance under spatial correlation
by deriving analytical lower and upper bounds for the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), respectively. Our results
demonstrate that FRIS effectively enables secure communication under spatial
correlation. Even with partial activation, FRIS significantly outperforms
conventional RISs in enhancing secrecy performance under varying deployment
densities and element correlations.

Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for
implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It
provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming
techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in
hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the
crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit
signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of
hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is
centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted
signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system
by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the
non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between
the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through
extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point
multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output
(MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility
of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.

Conclusion: URA为机器类型通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，将随机接入重新定义为编码问题，能够更好地适应大量设备的短包传输需求。

Abstract: Current wireless networks are designed to optimize spectral efficiency for
human users, who typically require sustained connections for high-data-rate
applications like file transfers and video streaming. However, these networks
are increasingly inadequate for the emerging era of machine-type communications
(MTC). With a vast number of devices exhibiting sporadic traffic patterns
consisting of short packets, the grant-based multiple access procedures
utilized by existing networks lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. To
address this issue the unsourced random access (URA) paradigm has been
proposed. This paradigm assumes the devices to share a common encoder thus
simplifying the reception process by eliminating the identification procedure.
The URA paradigm not only addresses the computational challenges but it also
considers the random access (RA) as a coding problem, i.e., takes into account
both medium access protocols and physical layer effects. In this monograph we
provide a comprehensive overview of the URA problem in noisy channels, with the
main task being to explain the major ideas rather than to list all existing
solutions.
