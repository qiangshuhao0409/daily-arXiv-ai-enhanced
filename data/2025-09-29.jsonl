However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in\ncomplex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic\nreasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other\nadvanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,\nwhere an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,\nbut is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that\ncontain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively\ncollect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are\ngrade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5\nonly achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning\npatterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the\nenvironment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its\nnearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the\nability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern\nin static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.\nBased on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to\nimprove LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models\nto revisit.

In this work, we\npropose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual\ninformation between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended\nmethod for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of\nLanguage Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment\nfrom multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and\nscaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly\ncorrelates with average task performance, characterize the impact of\nenvironmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model\nscale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment\nstates and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.\nTogether, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose\nmetric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings."}

The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus\ninput on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character\nrecognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a\nretrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,\nand external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with\nexplicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems\nthat primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by\nincorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading\ntrails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent\nevaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback\ncycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively\nworking to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment."}

To\nprovide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of\nthe Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by\nthe internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned\ngenerations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence\npoints where these deviations first become significant by tracking this\ndeviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline\nof internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where\nthe reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on\ndiverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the\nlow-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability\nbetween erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also\nvalidate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of\nreasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to\nmeasurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for\nin-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of\nblack-box models."}

Understanding the social logics these agents\nembody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily\nfocused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how\naltruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges\nin large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a\nSchelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,\ncompelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between\negoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings\nof these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to\nsystematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the\nfirst evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic\ntendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model\nselection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of\nchoosing an intrinsic social action logic. While \"Adaptive Egoists\" may offer a\nmore suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, \"Altruistic\nOptimizers\" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or\nscenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration."}

While reinforcement learning serves as a\npowerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally\nface two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit\nassignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.\nSecond, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to\nevaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we\nintroduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process\nsupervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a\npolicy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve\non each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,\noutcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic\nprocess evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the\npolicy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously\nrefine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly\nlarger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,\nthe co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable\nprocess verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of\nboth our own model and other existing LLMs."}

To address this limitation, we propose\nUniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that\nbridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or\nplain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the\ncommunication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while\nmaintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,\nlightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific\ndesigns-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token\nredundancy.

However,\nexisting approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking\nthe role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we\nobserve that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary\nsolution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of\ndiversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search\n(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable\ndimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic\nMoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate\ndiverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert\nConfiguration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a\nreasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and\ndiversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE\narchitectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and\nknowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing\naccuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as\na practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how\nstructural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning."}

Our theoretical\nanalyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce\nco-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning\nprimarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling\nbetter generalization.
