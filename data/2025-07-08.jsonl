Recent developments in Set Shaping Theory have revealed a\nsurprising result: it is always possible to transform a sequence into a longer\nversion by carefully selecting which longer sequences are allowed, in such a\nway that the overall set of sequences becomes more structured and less complex\nthan the original. This means that even though the sequence is extended and\ndependencies are introduced between symbols, the total amount of information\ncontained in the new set does not increase proportionally on the contrary, it\ncan be slightly reduced. In other words, one can construct a new set of longer\nsequences where each one corresponds uniquely to an original sequence, but the\nentire set is designed in such a way that it can be treated as if the symbols\nwere independent, making encoding simpler.

We investigate an $M_{t}/G/1/1$ queueing system with a\ntime-varying sampling rate and probabilistic preemption, proposing a novel\nanalytical framework based on multi-dimensional partial differential equations\n(PDEs) to capture the time evolution of the system's status distribution.

Solving these\nsubsystems allows us to derive the Aol distribution at arbitrary time\ninstances. We show AoI does not exhibit a memoryless property, even with\nnegligible processing times, due to its dependence on the historical sampling\nprocess. Our framework extends to the stationary setting, where we derive a\nclosed-form expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the\nsteady-state AoI.

First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the\nquestion of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment\ncontext, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying\nboth present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical\nadvances."}

The CT supplies\nhigh-fidelity channel-state information (CSI), which drives a two-stage\noptimization procedure.

Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for\ndefeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined\nbehaviors or domain-specific heuristics.

We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts.

Extensive experiments\nacross mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS\nreliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly\nreduced LLM rollouts."}

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods\nbased on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but\nPPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness.

When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in\nhuman-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to\ntheir human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in\ntasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can\nchange rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned\ncooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range\nof partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a\nvariational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.\nThis latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.\nSubsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering\nthe data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each\ntype of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to\npreviously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization\nalgorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.\nWe assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,\nposing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination\nacross a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show\nthat our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human\npartners."}

These\nfindings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a\npost-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for\nthe distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the\nkey property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce\na conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from\nCoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to\nstress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these\nguidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only\nwhen given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or\niterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not\ninfallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires\nactive protection and continued stress-testing."}

This makes them vulnerable to attacks and\nmotivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and\nstudy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in\nIoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is\noptimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as\npossible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are\noffline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another\nchallenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy\narrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the\nUAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nsolution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices\nto be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our\nsolution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to\nattestation by 30%."}

While artificial\nintelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and\nutilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks\n(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting\ntheir generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we\npropose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the\nstructural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly\napply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to\nwireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language\nmodel-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI\ntasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats\ncompatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt\nextracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI\nthrough three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human\nactivity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI\nachieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an\nimprovement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%\nreduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the\nnumber of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN\ndesign."}
