A\nPolar code distributes information among high and low-capacity channels,\nshowing the possibility of achieving perfect channel capacity. The\nhigh-capacity channels allow almost noiseless transmission of data. When these\nchannels are not high noise, reliability is achieved in the signal\ntransmission. It starts to compete against codes such a Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes. Polar code can be also considered error correcting,\nbased on the redundancy inherent in its structure. This feature makes polar\nencoding also applicable to digital quantum-resistant cryptography protocols.\nThis work explores linear decoding at a first or single trial in the case of\nsmall losses or small number of bit-flipping, and repeated transmission for\nmedium level losses. This is distinct from Arikans successive probabilistic\ndecoding by application of probabilistic rules.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to\nthe iterations of the belief propagation decoder.

The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where\nthe weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants\nof this decoder are investigated.

In\nthe first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic\nlow-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white\nGaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit\nerror rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static\nWBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio.

Lower latency\nconstraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade\ndecoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system\nis considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its\nabundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically\ncapacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical\napplicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly\napplied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large\nspatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the\nspatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within\nthis framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization\nbehavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving\nproperty of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints\nand large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to\ntraditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly\nreduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve\nreliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving\nand latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in\nfuture 6G URLLC scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6781\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e6G URLLC\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u54116G\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e2d\uff0cURLLC\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6781\u7f16\u7801\u56e0\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528MMSE\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u7684SINR\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u9ad8\u65af\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6781\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u57df\u6781\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u548c\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a6G URLLC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, several\ncritical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network\nresources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude\neconomy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything\ncommunication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we\nformulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control,\nand flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI\nfeedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV\ncommunication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint.\nTo this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original\nlong-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then\npropose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm,\nwhich innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel\nallocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key\ncomponent of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected\nfor years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has improved the situation by fixing\nthe issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with\nproxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH (ODoH), which separate a user's\nidentity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion\nassumptions between DNS resolvers and proxies -- an assumption difficult to\nguarantee in practice. To address this, we explore integrating single-server\nPrivate Information Retrieval (PIR) into DNS to enable encrypted query\nprocessing without relying on trust assumptions. However, applying PIR to DNS\nis challenging due to its hierarchical nature -- particularly, interactions\nwith recursive resolvers can still leak information. Navigating performance and\nprivacy trade-offs, we propose PDNS, a DNS extension leveraging single-server\nPIR to strengthen privacy guarantees. We have implemented a prototype of PDNS\nand compared its performance against state-of-the-art solutions via\ntrace-driven experiments.

In\nthis way, considering a transport network, a key requirement is to handle\nunexpected traffic variability and dynamically adapt to maintain optimal\nperformance in the associated virtual model, known as the virtual twin (VTwin).\nIn this context, we propose a self-adaptive implementation of a novel NDT\narchitecture designed to provide accurate delay predictions, even under\nfluctuating traffic conditions. This architecture addresses an essential\nchallenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of\ndata-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving\nsynchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the\ncontributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the\noperational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming\ntraffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions\naimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our\narchitecture with a network management use case, across various emulated\nnetwork topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting per-flow\ndelay under unexpected traffic variation. The results in all tested topologies,\nusing the normalized mean square error as the evaluation metric, demonstrate\nthat our proposed architecture, after a traffic concept drift, achieves a\nperformance improvement in prediction of at least 56.7% compared to a\nconfiguration without NDT synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08NDT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6d41\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u865a\u62df\u5b6a\u751f\uff08VTwin\uff09\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff08PTwin\uff09\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684NDT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9065\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u76d1\u6d4b\u6d41\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u6307\u5bfcVTwin\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6d41\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u540e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1156.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86NDT\u5728\u6d41\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for\nmobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with\ncontinuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve\nas the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that\nintegrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the\nassociated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the\nfirst one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on\nthe user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)\nobservations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).\nSimulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is\nmore scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy\nautomatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the\noverhead of initiating HOs.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences.

Recent\npost-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify\ntoken generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward\nfunction KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A\ncritical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward\nmodel, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially\nunstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that\nintegrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,\neliminating the need for a reward model.

However, existing methods often rely on abstracted\nperception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as\nfine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are\nessential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a\nlearning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of\nreasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,\ndetailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning\ncapabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe\ntrajectories.

This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times.

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge.

However, these programs often\nsuffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through\nreal-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit\nmodel, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service\ncall interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one\nkey question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via\nAI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and\nhealth behaviors?

As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u201c\u8fdb\u5316\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\u3001\u201c\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u201d\u548c\u201c\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u5316\u201d\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\uff08ASI\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
