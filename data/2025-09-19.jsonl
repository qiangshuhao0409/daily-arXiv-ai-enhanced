In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's\nbackscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low\nmodulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To\nimprove the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with\nHAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption\nand transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and\nAC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs\nunder the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC\nordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients,\nthe transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU\nduring BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's\ntransmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints\ninvolved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC\nordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further\nconsiders the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our\nproposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that: 1) the proposed mutualistic SR system outperforms\ntraditional designs in terms of the rates achieved by SUs under the same\nconstraints; 2) the total rate of all SUs under the dynamic SIC ordering is\nlarger than that of the fixed one when the PT's minimum rate gain is high, and\nbecomes nearly identical when the PT's minimum rate gain is low."}

To derive the exact-optimal solution to the\nMMF problem (as opposed to approximations), conventional methods usually\ninvolve two steps: first calculate the scheduling rate region, and then find\nthe maximum multiflow that can be supported by the achievable link rates.\nHowever, the NP-hardness of the scheduling part makes solving the MMF problem\nin large networks computationally prohibitive. In this paper, while still\nfocusing on the exact-optimal solution, we provide efficient algorithms that\ncan jointly calculate the scheduling rate region and solve the MMF problem,\nthereby outputting optimal values without requiring the entire scheduling rate\nregion. We theoretically prove that our algorithms always output optimal\nsolutions in a finite number of iterations, and we use various simulation\nresults to demonstrate our advantages over conventional approaches.

This paper addresses the\npronounced near-field beam squint problem caused by phase shifter based\nbeamforming in wideband near-field scenarios and proposes a beam squint\nassisted joint angle-distance localization scheme. The key idea is to employ\ntrue-time-delay (TTD) units together with phase shifters (PS) to synthesize a\ncontrollable joint angle-distance (JAD) trajectory that establishes a unique\nmapping between subcarriers and spatial locations, enabling single scan\nacquisition of target angle and range.

While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent\npopulations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention\nfollowing, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,\ntogether with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution\ntailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing\nteam may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,\npotentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide\nrecommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose\nfuture research directions to account for biases introduced by different\ntesting environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer\nboth strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more\ntransparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex\nsocial settings."}

In complex and dynamic maritime environments, trust in AI depends not\nonly on performance but also on transparency and interpretability. This paper\nhighlights the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for effective\nhuman-machine teaming in the maritime domain, where informed oversight and\nshared understanding are essential. To support the user-centered integration of\nXAI, we propose a domain-specific survey designed to capture maritime\nprofessionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability. Our aim is\nto foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems\ntailored to the needs of seafarers and maritime teams."}

While inference-time methods can\nmitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs\nstruggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes\nunder exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as\nan intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce\nMulti-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that\npost-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal\nconsensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These\ntrajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning\nin peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating\nricher consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents\nto teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer\ninsights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving\nsubstantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K),\nsingle-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4%\nPass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).\nThese findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3%\non GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more\nreliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU."}

Addressing these\nchallenges requires extending current simulator architectures with AI\nalgorithms for both traffic prediction and dynamic agent planning. This paper\npresents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements.\nPreliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising\nvehicular planning algorithms can lead to improved battery and QoS performance\ncompared with traditional shortest path algorithms. The additional inclusion of\ndesirability areas enabled more ambulances to be routed to their target\ndestinations while utilising less energy to do so, compared to traditional and\nweighted algorithms without desirability considerations."}
