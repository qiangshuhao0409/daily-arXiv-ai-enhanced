Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond."}

Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL."}

Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization."}

Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems."}

In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments."}

This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas."}

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes."}

Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery."}

We show two \"rough edges\" in how commercial VPNs handle IPv6. First, we show that many IPv4-only VPNs leak IPv6 traffic to the ISP. Individual use VPNs in part to conceal their local IP addresses, so such leaks reduce user privacy. While prior work has studied VPNs in testbeds, we use a new dataset of 129k VPN-using daily visitors to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com that quantifies these leaks and show 12 VPNs previously considered safe still leak for at least 5% of their users. We show native IPv6 addresses leak most commonly in VPNs that claim only IPv4 support, with 5% to 57% of visitors of v4-only VPNs having their native IPv6 address exposed. Second, we show that most dual-stack VPNs users actually select IPv4 instead of IPv6. We observe this problem in our visitor data, and we identify the root cause arises because when user's computer follows standard address-selection rules, VPN-assigned addresses are often de-preferenced. Testing six VPNs on Android, we show that five consistently de-prioritize IPv6. Finally, we suggest a solution to IPv6 de-preferencing: we define a new IPv6 address range for VPNs that is not de-preferenced by address selection. We prototype this solution on Linux. Our findings help identify and address rough edges in the addition of IPv6 support to VPNs."}

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject."}

To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline.

To bridge this gap, we propose Jazz, a system that re-architects multipath congestion control through a decoupled architecture that separates the decision-making ``brain'' from the in-kernel datapath, enabling it to operate on an external (edge) entity. At its core, Jazz employs a Transformer-based agent that processes sequences of historical observations to overcome the partial observability of single-step reinforcement learning. This allows it to learn and master fluctuating link conditions and intricate cross-path dependencies. Tested on a dual-band (5GHz/6GHz) Wi-Fi testbed, our implementation improves bandwidth efficiency by at least 2.85\\% over conventional methods and maintains 96.2\\% performance under 1\\% packet loss, validating this design as a practical blueprint for agile network intelligence."}

Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery."}

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data."}

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly."}

In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge).

In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants.

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting."}

While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem.

Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions."}

To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems."}

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale."}

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping."}

We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset."}

We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning."}

However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/."}

In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments."}

These networks support a wide range of applications and services, including highly sensitive and mission-critical ones, which demand rapid and accurate detection and resolution of network errors. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods are no longer efficient for such complex environments.\\cite{b1} In this study, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network fault detection and classification. Various types of network errors were intentionally injected into a Kubernetes-based test network, and data were collected under both healthy and faulty conditions. The dataset includes logs from different network components (pods), along with complementary data such as system descriptions, events, Round Trip Time (RTT) tests, and pod status information. The dataset covers common fault types such as pod failure, pod kill, network delay, network loss, and disk I/O failures. We fine-tuned the GPT-4.1 nano model via its API on this dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in fault-detection accuracy compared to the base model. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches for achieving closed-loop, and operator-free fault management, which can enhance network reliability and reduce downtime-related operational costs for service providers."}

Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL."}
