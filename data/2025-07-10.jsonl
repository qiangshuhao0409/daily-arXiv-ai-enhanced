These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course.

To tackle this\nchallenge, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged, aiming to\nutilize low-altitude airspace to establish a three-dimensional transportation\nsystem. Among various components of the AAM system, electric vertical take-off\nand landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a pivotal role due to their flexibility and\nefficiency. However, the immaturity of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication\n(URLLC) technologies poses significant challenges to safety-critical AAM\noperations.

To bridge this gap, we employ network\ncalculus tools to derive the probabilistic upper bound on communication delay\nin the AAM system for the first time. Furthermore, we formulate a complex\nnon-convex optimization problem that jointly minimizes the probabilistic delay\nbound and the propagation delay.

Unlike many existing works that assume a\nparticular probability distribution model for fading channels (which is\ntypically Gaussian), our approach merely relies on the first and second moments\nof fading channels. For the stochastic precoding problem, a naive idea is to\ndirectly apply the fractional programming (FP) method to the data rate inside\nthe expectation; it does not work well because the auxiliary variables\nintroduced by FP are then difficult to decide. To address the above issue, we\npropose using a lower bound to approximate the expectation of data rate. This\nlower bound stems from a nontrivial use of the matrix FP, and outperforms the\nexisting lower bounds in that it accounts for generalized fading channels whose\nfirst and second moments are known. The resulting approximate problem can be\nefficiently solved in closed form in an iterative fashion.
