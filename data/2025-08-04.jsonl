Therefore, this paper\ninvestigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted\nmillimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks\nthat structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation\nand kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the\ninherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the\nestimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel\nestimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a\nFourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator\nin the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the\ncontinuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with\nmesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO)\narchitecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy\nof spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO\nsignificantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and\npilot efficiency.

The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging\nthread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and\ncache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency\nscaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks"}

A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be\navailable (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive\nand interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for\nspectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model\nof primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R\n(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures\ntemporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss\nand clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference\nthresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the\nproposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with\nimproved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach,\nanalyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions,\nlimitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be\nadapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show\nthat the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low\ncomputational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in\ncognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems."}

However,\ncloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable\nresponsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic\nstate abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a\nheterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an\naction impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent\nin maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on\nboth Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm\nsignificantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared\nto existing baselines."}

However, compared with traditional\nwireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude\noperations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it\nmore vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some\nlarge artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure\ncommunications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security\nrisks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we\nintroduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in\naddressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for\nsecure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization\nframework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced\nstate features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic\nrewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for\nsecure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline\nfuture directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications."}

Their account proposes an inverse relation between the\ninformativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach\nassigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to\nas the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a\ndistance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.\nUnfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.\n  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on\nits own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new\napproach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of\ntheories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy\nwith von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for\ninformativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and\nremoves the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have\nzero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each\nother are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an\nexample."}
