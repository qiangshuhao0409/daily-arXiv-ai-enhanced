High-performance localization and sensing\nsystems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent\napplications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning\nhas recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the\nspatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the\nfrequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nwaveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of\nlocalization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of\nMIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to\njointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their\npotential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a\nmixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic\nproximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)\nalgorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale\ndatasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and\nmemory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence\nguarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its\neffectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and\nsensing optimization."}

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

This paper argues that, contrary\nto prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead\nto a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those\nwith limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the\nperformance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating\nthat under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability\nreturns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,\nwe argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies\nthat can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will\neventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we\ngive several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture\nimportant capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and\ntheoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the\ncapability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the\nincreasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require\nreexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect."}

In this work, we take a step toward that\ngoal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and\nbroadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what\noccupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and\nprivacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a\npublicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work\nactivities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and\nwriting, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are\nproviding information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.\nCombining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and\nscope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We\nfind the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups\nsuch as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as\nwell as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and\ncommunicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work\nactivities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with\nAI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of\noccupational AI impact."}
