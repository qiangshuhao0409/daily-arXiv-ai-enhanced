Through comprehensive\nevaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that\nYOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited\ntransparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical\ninterpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in\nour experiments.

The maximum a posteriori\nprobability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP\nestimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation\nof the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is\nuseful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low\ncomplexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time\ninvariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal\nalgorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of\nsymbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among\nthe temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation\nperformance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that\nthe BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is\nstrongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of\nthe 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being\nnon-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since\nthe BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a\nguideline for pilot signal design."}

These algorithms significantly reduce\nimplementation complexity while maintaining expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR)\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that require global channel\nenumeration. To ensure bounded maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) in the\nasynchronous setting, we further introduce the ASYM-LC-LSH4 and QR-LC-LSH4\nalgorithms by embedding multiset-enhanced modular clock and quasi-random\ntechniques into our framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithms achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LSH\nalgorithms in both synchronous and asynchronous settings, even without a global\nchannel enumeration system."}

To minimize the inference error, we aim to design a signal-agnostic\nscheduling policy that leverages AoI without requiring knowledge of the actual\ntarget values or the source observations. This scheduling problem is a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function.

To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities.

However, the optimization of\nSharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there\nexist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems.

By introducing\nconcepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's\nperformance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based\ninsights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,\nvolunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured\ndecision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently\naccurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based\nsystems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms\nhuman operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These\nfindings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework\nfor building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical\ncontexts."}

Yet providers must protect\ntheir services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web\nagents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on\nagents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.\nWe start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that\nare asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning\ngates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate\nwith real-world web agents.

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.

This paper identifies four core problems that must be\nsolved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)\ngeneralization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,\nspecifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)\nlong-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,\nspecifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support.

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL.

This survey\nformalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,\npartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one\norganized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,\nmemory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their\napplications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that\nreinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these\ncapabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic\nbehavior.

With\nthe massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in\nmobile applications to address privacy concerns.

To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular\nMachine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted\ntraffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is\ntraffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training\n(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and\nlong-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection\nof every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming.
