These computing resources\nare often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy\nstates, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are\ncommonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely\nfocuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a\nrudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key\nobservation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize\nit. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,\nwhere the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.\nAssuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to\nsample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available\njobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job.

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.

In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based\nencoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS\nLoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph\nsymbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF\nconfiguration of the symbol for data decoding.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such\ncontext-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of\nthe ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination.

Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve\nsuperior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are\nproposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,\nemphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)\nAutomatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization\nmethod is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient\nsearch strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary\nalgorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.\nExtensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that\nAutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and\nachieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,\nAutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned\nalternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in\nhandling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven\nheuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides\nboth methodological advancements and empirically validated results for\nnext-generation complex solver development.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoModSAT\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f18\u5316SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534750%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u566830%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534750%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u6c42\u89e3\u566830%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720%\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoModSAT\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}
