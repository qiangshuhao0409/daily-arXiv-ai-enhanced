By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes\nwith low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is\nthe minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off."}

Our\nfindings show that BBR consistently achieves high throughput across all\nenvironments, with especially strong performance and fairness in scenarios\ninvolving homogeneous BBR flows or high bandwidth Internet paths.

We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured\nCausal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy\nfunctions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and\ninterventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes\ninternal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which\nrelations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We\nprovide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM\nin the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization\nsystematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we\nanalyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under\nmild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's\nprinciples (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as\nexplanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for\ncausal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict."}

The AI market size is projected\nto grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI\nis dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual\nintelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data\nscraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train\nGPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic\nthat prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In\ncontrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the\nnext level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal\nmodels with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions\nin dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning\ncontinuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making\ncapability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's\nlarge models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient\ndomain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of\nuncertainty.

By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the\noptimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,\ntherefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of\nmulti-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded\nattacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from\nincomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are\nproposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger\nscenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,\nwe propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by\nclarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more\neffective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize\nthe reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial\nexamples for the first time."}

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge.

This gap has motivated growing efforts to design\ncollaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and\nAI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of\nHuman AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of\nreliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty\nQuantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human\nexpert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,\nensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,\nenabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population\nlevel, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an\nintuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a\nclassical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop\npractical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution\nfree finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,\nincluding human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we\ncall Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,\nregression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative\nprediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher\ncoverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions."}
