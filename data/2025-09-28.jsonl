Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all\ntemporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital\nAirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map\nhigh-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated\ninto symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp\ntransceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across\nagents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals.\nTo endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a\nsurrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of\nfeature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we\nformulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization,\nand develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit\nallocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and\nhybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy\nand uncertainty."}

Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "summary": "This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,\nmodeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.\nTo characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument\nis invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their\ncodebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in\nthe literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the\ntransmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading\ncoefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed\nthat the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,\nrigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds\ndepends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering\ncells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the\ninterferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay\nexponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit\npower. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited\nnetworks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews (\"Fundamental limits of\ncooperation\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by\nrandom user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In\ncontrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,\nthen the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded\ncapacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since\nthe condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents\ninterference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple\naccess.

With recent development of powerful large language models\n(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network\nmanagement accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to\nconverse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage\nadvancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate\nrepresentation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,\nretrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface\nfor external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data\nof natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization\ninterface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale\ndata collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both\nsynthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and\nvisualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and\ndemocratize network control for everyday users."}

This paper proposes an\ninnovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we\nintroduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive\nadversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated\nencoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning\nattacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism\nto deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of\nthe proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are\npointed out to advance this emerging field."}

However, the\ntheoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims\nto investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called\nconcept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on\napplying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs\nwell for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In\naddition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by\nthe LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the\nprompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights\nand guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,\nthe impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM\nembeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,\nseveral real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical\nusefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory."}

Deploying edge cameras\nacross urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road\nconditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a\nrobust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface\nfor user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ninterpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment\non edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM\ninference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from\nedge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential\ndelays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we\npropose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces\ntransmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to\ngenerate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%\nreduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy\nof 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original\ncropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT\nand LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic\nsurveillance."}
