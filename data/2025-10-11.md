### [1] [DRACO: Data Replication and Collection Framework for Enhanced Data Availability and Robustness in IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07464)
*Waleed Bin Qaim,Oznur Ozkasap,Rabia Qadar,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DRACO是一个集成分布式逐跳数据复制和无开销移动汇聚数据收集的框架，通过优化副本放置和数据检索来提高物联网数据可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网系统面临资源受限和不可靠设备导致的数据丢失挑战，需要确保高效的数据生成、收集和管理。

Method: 结合分布式逐跳数据复制方法和无开销移动汇聚数据收集策略，优化副本放置并确保节点故障和网络密度变化下的高效数据检索。

Result: ns-3仿真显示，相比贪婪和随机复制技术，DRACO分别提高数据可用性15%和34%，副本创建18%和40%，并在不同节点密度和故障场景下实现更优的数据收集效率。

Conclusion: DRACO通过解决物联网数据管理的关键挑战，为新兴应用场景提供了可扩展且具有弹性的解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and digital
worlds, enabling seamless interaction with real-world objects via the Internet.
However, IoT systems face significant challenges in ensuring efficient data
generation, collection, and management, particularly due to the
resource-constrained and unreliable nature of connected devices, which can lead
to data loss. This paper presents DRACO (Data Replication and Collection), a
framework that integrates a distributed hop-by-hop data replication approach
with an overhead-free mobile sink-based data collection strategy. DRACO
enhances data availability, optimizes replica placement, and ensures efficient
data retrieval even under node failures and varying network densities.
Extensive ns-3 simulations demonstrate that DRACO outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques, improving data availability by up to 15% and 34%, and replica
creation by up to 18% and 40%, compared to greedy and random replication
techniques, respectively. DRACO also ensures efficient data dissemination
through optimized replica distribution and achieves superior data collection
efficiency under varying node densities and failure scenarios as compared to
commonly used uncontrolled sink mobility approaches namely random walk and
self-avoiding random walk. By addressing key IoT data management challenges,
DRACO offers a scalable and resilient solution well-suited for emerging use
cases.

### [2] [TDoA-Based Self-Supervised Channel Charting with NLoS Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08001)
*Mohsen Ahadi,Omid Esrafilian,Florian Kaltenberger,Adeel Malik*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的通道图表方法，利用增强的CIR数据和UE位移测量，在真实5G测试环境中实现2-4米的定位精度，并公开了相关数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道图表方法难以扩展到全球范围，且难以处理NLoS条件引入的失真问题，需要开发更鲁棒的定位解决方案。

Method: 利用增强的CIR数据（包含TDoA和TRP位置），结合短间隔UE位移测量，并采用NLoS噪声测量识别和掩蔽机制。

Result: 在真实5G测试环境中，90%情况下实现2-4米定位精度，优于现有的半监督和自监督通道图表方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实5G网络中表现出色，能够有效处理NLoS条件，为自监督定位提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel Charting (CC) has emerged as a promising framework for data-driven
radio localization, yet existing approaches often struggle to scale globally
and to handle the distortions introduced by non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions. In this work, we propose a novel CC method that leverages Channel
Impulse Response (CIR) data enriched with practical features such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Transmission Reception Point (TRP) locations,
enabling a self-supervised localization function on a global scale. The
proposed framework is further enhanced with short-interval User Equipment (UE)
displacement measurements, which improve the continuity and robustness of the
learned positioning function. Our algorithm incorporates a mechanism to
identify and mask NLoS-induced noisy measurements, leading to significant
performance gains. We present the evaluations of our proposed models in a real
5G testbed and benchmarked against centimeter-accurate Real-Time Kinematic
(RTK) positioning, in an O-RAN--based 5G network by OpenAirInterface (OAI)
software at EURECOM. It demonstrated outperforming results against the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised CC approaches in a
real-world scenario. The results show localization accuracies of 2-4 meters in
90% of cases, across a range of NLoS ratios. Furthermore, we provide public
datasets of CIR recordings, along with the true position labels used in this
paper's evaluation.

### [3] [When Light Bends to the Collective Will: A Theory and Vision for Adaptive Photonic Scale-up Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08072)
*Vamsi Addanki*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析可编程光子互连在集体通信中的重构延迟与性能增益之间的权衡，并探讨了何时重构是值得的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着芯片间硅光子技术的普及，集体通信成为扩展系统的关键瓶颈。可编程光子互连通过动态重构网络拓扑，能够为集体操作建立直接的高带宽光路，但需要权衡重构延迟和自适应拓扑的性能增益。

Method: 提出了一个简单的理论框架，明确量化重构延迟与性能增益的权衡关系。该框架连接了Birkhoff-von Neumann分解、最大并发流和集体通信的α-β成本模型。

Result: 理论框架澄清了何时网络重构是值得的，为自适应光子扩展域的设计提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为算法设计和系统集成提供了一个基础，未来可以在这一框架上构建更深入的研究议程。

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$-$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

Abstract: The evolution from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 introduces stringent
requirements for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to support
human centric, intelligent, and resilient industrial systems. Sixth-generation
(6G) wireless networks aim to meet these requirements through sub-millisecond
end-to-end delays, microsecond level jitter, and near perfect reliability,
enabled by advances such as terahertz (THz) communication, reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and AI driven
cross layer optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive review of URLLC
solutions for 6G enabled industry 5.0, organized into a structured taxonomy
including application domains, key technical enablers, design challenges, and
performance enhancements. The survey examines emerging approaches, including
digital twin integration, AI/ML based resource orchestration, Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) enabled service function chaining, and cross domain
networking, while mapping them to critical industrial scenarios such as smart
manufacturing, connected healthcare, autonomous mobility, remote control, and
next-generation mobile networks. Performance trade-offs between latency,
reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency are analyzed in the context of
representative state-of-the-art studies. Finally, the paper identifies open
challenges and outlines future research directions to realize deterministic,
secure, and sustainable URLLC architectures for Industry 5.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区块链系统的可扩展性受到低效P2P广播的限制，大多数优化只关注逻辑层而忽略了物理网络条件。

Method: 采用分布式控制平面获取全局网络视图，使用图引擎进行分层聚类，结合混合宏微观邻居选择和分层广播机制。

Result: 专用仿真平台显示，BlockSDN相比Gossip和Mercury分别减少了65%和55%的全局区块同步时间。

Conclusion: SDN支持的跨层协调具有显著提升区块链可扩展性和性能的潜力。

Abstract: The scalability of blockchain systems is constrained by inefficient P2P
broadcasting, as most existing optimizations focus only on the logical layer
without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose
BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN
employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine
for hierarchical clustering, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with
hierarchical broadcasting. A dedicated simulation platform shows that BlockSDN
reduces global block synchronization time by 65% and 55% compared to Gossip and
Mercury, respectively.These results highlight the potential of SDN-enabled
cross-layer coordination to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and
performance.

### [6] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD)，一种基于知识库的验证导向解码方案，通过语义防护机制在解码时减少语言模型的幻觉生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经语言生成与知识库对齐的问题，减少大规模经验模型中的事实错误和幻觉，同时保持生成效率。

Method: 采用基于约束的语义学，在解码时引入语义防护格，通过知识感知的安全质量量化事实风险，并使用多智能体操作演算进行实现验证。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，该方法能在不牺牲吞吐量的情况下有效减少幻觉，为大规模经验模型与形式验证之间搭建实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD提供了一种实用的解码方案，成功地将神经语言生成与知识验证相结合，实现了形式验证与实证模型的融合。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [7] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习框架，用于工业物联网的自主防御，通过语义感知状态表示和协作策略学习，显著提升威胁检测和响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的普及使关键网络物理系统面临复杂多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏情境感知能力，需要更智能的自适应安全解决方案。

Method: 融合LLM和MARL：使用LLM将非结构化遥测数据转换为语义感知状态表示，利用MAPPO算法学习协作防御策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和MITRE ATT&CK ICS合成数据集上，L2M-AID检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了一个强大的新范式，通过深度融合LLM语义理解和MARL协作学习，实现了自适应和弹性的工业防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [8] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思维语言模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制来实现性能提升，而非学习全新能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思维模型是否真正学习新的推理能力，还是只是重新利用基础模型中已有的能力。

Method: 提出混合模型方法，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制，并使用无监督、自下而上的方法发现可解释的推理行为。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思维模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [9] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例，探讨生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化和纵向护理路径，并引入心理健康数字孪生作为个性化心理健康护理的变革框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维的需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化和连续的护理方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进诊断协调，并构建心理健康数字孪生作为持续更新的计算模型。

Result: AI能够有效进行患者数据采样，实现动态适应个体需求和病情变化，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康护理将从连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样中受益，心理健康数字孪生框架为个性化护理提供了变革性方向，需要进一步研究来完善和实施。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [10] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个模块化多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演化实现迭代问题解决，在FinanceBench基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重新规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人工反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应且与人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空预测框架，通过引入新的SpatioSemantic专家，将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合，在交通预测任务上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合，并进行战略性的专家选择。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs. 3.14），在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%（1.65 vs. 1.72）。最佳配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs. 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 战略性设计的少量专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在保持最先进性能的同时具有更优的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

### [12] [The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197)
*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的成对比较框架，仅需m-1次比较就能获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重且容易产生不一致性，计算复杂度高。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的针对性比较集进行专家判断收集，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。

Result: 该方法确保了一致性，将偏好建模的维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，且与经典卡片法兼容。

Conclusion: TTM方法通过设计确保一致性，最小化认知努力，并开发了基于Web的工具来展示其在实际决策场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLM的推理能力与时间序列分析工具结合，避免知识泄漏和幻觉问题，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，常出现幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要一种能充分利用LLM优势同时避免其缺陷的解决方案。

Method: 设计TS-Agent代理，让LLM专注于证据收集和结论合成，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，使用自批判和质量门控机制迭代优化推理。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到SOTA LLM水平，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型，特别是在零样本设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过合理分工设计，有效解决了LLM在时间序列推理中的局限性，提供了可解释、可验证的解决方案，避免了多模态对齐训练的需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

### [15] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，未经训练的LLM（如ChatGPT o3模型）能够有效理解BPMN流程模型图像，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答相关问题。不同LLM在准确性和有效性方面表现各异，但都能作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，分析其在不同深度层面（语法、逻辑、语义）的回答表现。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型并智能回答相关问题，不同LLM在性能上存在差异。LLM在流程分析和优化中展现出类似人类的推理能力。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，展现出类似人类的特性，在流程分析和优化方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: 本文研究了医疗智能系统的伦理风险优化问题，使用MIP、SAT和CP三种方法求解，并通过Minizinc建模进行比较分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案列为高风险系统，需要正式的伦理风险管理流程来确保可信AI要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，使用混合整数规划、可满足性和约束编程三种求解范式，并用Minizinc建模语言实现。

Result: 进行了比较实验研究，分析了每种方法在性能、表达能力和可扩展性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 从方法学限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作方向。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决流行路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两个阶段来识别和创建热门路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要模型训练、参数调优和重新训练来处理数据更新，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别流行路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出卓越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为流行路径查询提供了一种有效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个量化多智能体辩论中身份偏见的框架，通过响应匿名化减少身份偏见，并定义了身份偏见系数来测量偏见程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明多智能体辩论中的智能体存在身份驱动的谄媚和自偏见问题，会不加批判地采纳同伴观点或固执坚持自己的输出，这削弱了辩论的可靠性。

Method: 1. 将辩论动态形式化为身份加权的贝叶斯更新过程；2. 提出响应匿名化方法，通过移除身份标记使智能体无法区分"自己"和"同伴"；3. 定义身份偏见系数来量化偏见程度。

Result: 在多个模型、数据集和辩论轮次上的实证研究表明身份偏见普遍存在，其中谄媚偏见远多于自偏见。响应匿名化能有效减少身份偏见。

Conclusion: 需要"掩盖"身份以确保多智能体辩论系统基于内容而非来源身份进行推理，响应匿名化是减少身份偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言中的个人身份信息检测面临语言多样性和标注数据有限的问题，这对隐私合规性提出了挑战。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合正则表达式和LLMs，使用三阶段精炼流程进行消歧和过滤，模块化设计支持300多个实体类型且无需重新训练。

Result: 在加权F1分数上，该系统比微调的NER模型高出82%，比零样本LLMs高出17%。

Conclusion: RECAP为合规性应用提供了一个可扩展且适应性强的PII检测解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告等严重漏洞，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，迫切需要建立统一可信的评估标准。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用密封执行、题库滚动更新和延迟透明度等机制，构建社区治理的监考式评估蓝图。

Result: PeerBench框架为建立可信AI评估提供了系统性解决方案，能够有效防止数据污染和选择性报告问题。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方式不可持续，需要向统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架转变，PeerBench为此提供了可行的实施路径。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递中插入必要问题来阻止错误传播，提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会在整个链中传播），它们经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从精选的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链接局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误在阶段间静默传递而难以信任，需要可追踪和可问责的系统设计。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic流水线结构，评估8种配置的三种最先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化问责交接显著提高准确性并防止简单流水线中的常见失败；模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；准确性-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

TL;DR: 论文发现现有评估指标系统性地低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，提出了组匹配分数和测试时匹配算法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标低估了前沿AI模型在组合推理方面的真实能力，导致模型在基准测试中表现不佳。

Method: 引入组匹配分数以更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法，这是一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 该方法使SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现，在16个数据集变体上均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和应用TTM算法，可以揭示并大幅提升AI模型的隐藏组合推理能力，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中经常添加新物品，现有离策略学习方法在探索新物品时存在安全隐患，需要开发能保证安全的探索框架。

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG方法，基于高置信度离策略评估确保安全性；然后提出DEPL框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实现的同时，有效探索新物品，解决了安全性和探索性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个可复现的仿真框架，用于评估生成式智能体在多模态环境中的安全性、连贯性和信任度。研究发现当前智能体在检测多模态矛盾方面表现良好，但在全局安全对齐方面存在局限，特别是在误导性视觉信息面前容易过度信任图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使智能体能够在丰富环境中自主行动并追求目标，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 开发了可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体在多模态矛盾检测方面表现良好，但在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%。在三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的八次仿真中，不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键局限性，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，通过在每个控制步骤持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的定量距离，从而产生反映瞬时状态动态的奖励，解决了现有方法中稀疏全局奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时安全关键的网络物理系统中，控制综合必须保证在不确定和动态条件下生成的策略满足严格的时序和正确性要求。现有将STL奖励函数融入RL的方法只能获得全局或部分路径的评估，无法准确累积局部变化的奖励，导致稀疏的全局奖励可能引起不收敛和不稳定的训练性能。

Method: 提出在线奖励生成方法，通过STL在线因果监控指导，在每个控制步骤持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的定量距离。同时提供因果语义的平滑近似，克服因果语义的不连续性，使其适用于深度RL方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中对多种连续控制基准进行了评估，实验结果表明，提出的基于STL在线因果语义的RL方法优于现有的相关STL指导RL方法，为深度RL提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 该方法通过STL在线因果监控实现了更精确的奖励生成，解决了现有方法中奖励稀疏性问题，提高了RL训练的收敛性和稳定性，为安全关键系统的控制综合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否真正具备化学推理能力，即生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径的能力。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000+标注的机理步骤；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分；分析SOTA LLM性能，并探索提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难；使用提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严格基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著提升空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合分层引用图来生成更结构化和全面的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容进行总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合层内水平搜索和跨层垂直深度遍历，生成多级摘要，并通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中都优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，为自动化综述生成提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA是一个基于LLM的医疗智能代理架构，通过可验证的推理过程确保可靠性，在医疗管理任务中实现超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为医疗领域对准确性要求极高，错误是不可接受的。

Method: 采用递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，并引入"引导"模式将已验证的推理链存储为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域的验证中，MMIA实现了超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，显著优于基线LLM，RAG模式预计可将处理成本降低约85%。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GRAIL框架，将测试时图域自适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用大语言模型将目标图恢复到源域状态，解决源域数据不可访问的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应方法依赖源域数据，但源域数据常因隐私或安全问题不可用，因此需要开发无需源域示例的测试时图域自适应方法。

Method: 使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程，将节点表示压缩为紧凑潜在特征，通过量化模块编码为离散标记，微调LLM作为生成式恢复器，并引入强化学习过程优化恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功解决了测试时图域自适应问题，通过生成式图恢复方法在无需源域数据的情况下实现了有效的域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分解方法是启发式的，依赖于智能体或手动分解，导致LLM在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题。

Method: 引入ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂度度量来系统性地指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过基于复杂度的分解，智能体性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统性的约束诱导复杂度分析，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等强化学习方法的局限性，使模型在无法解决问题时能从参考答案学习，提高训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对的样本中学习知识。需要一种能利用外部参考信息的方法来突破这一限制。

Method: 提出Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，在训练过程中引入外部标准参考答案。当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过引入外部参考答案，有效解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型在推理任务上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SHADOW框架，通过强化学习在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与暴露风险的通信策略，实现更高的追捕成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗环境中存在信息获取与暴露风险的关键权衡：通信能增强态势感知，但同时会暴露自身位置增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈模型，使用SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，集成连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线获得更高成功率，时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协作推理优化机制和双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实世界道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基线方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由奠定基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构中作用边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示、缺乏可解释性等局限性，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：强大的教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验从时间序列推断有向因果图；轻量级学生代理细化图并在高置信度因果关联上进行微调，这些关联被编码为丰富的文本提示用于预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法进行广泛实验，Augur实现了有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，展示了LLM在时间序列预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面框架，有助于推动该领域从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research

Method: 基于现有以人为中心的AI透明度方法，结合社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念

Result: 开发了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应允许公众参与影响他们生活的AI系统

Conclusion: 有意义透明度能够连接理解与行动潜力，帮助公众更好地参与和塑造影响他们生活的AI决策过程

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Motivation: LLM金融代理在回测中表现出色，但由于LLM内在的信息泄露问题，一旦超出模型知识窗口，实际表现就会大幅下降，这被称为"利润幻象"。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含四个核心组件：策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器，通过反事实扰动迫使LLM学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化能力上超越所有基线方法，提供更优的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效解决了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和实际交易表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供早期指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升LLM代理适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-SHE框架，通过SRPO算法结合逐步奖励模型和人工验证器，解决电商搜索相关性分析中现有方法的泛化性和推理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练方法在长尾查询上泛化能力差，缺乏细粒度监督来确保规则对齐的推理，而强化学习方法存在反馈稀疏问题，无法纠正错误的中间推理步骤。

Method: 使用Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO)算法，结合高质量生成式逐步奖励模型和人工标注离线验证器，采用多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习技术。

Result: 在真实世界搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了大规模电商环境下的性能表现，还增强了系统的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VoiceAgentBench基准测试，用于评估语音语言模型在真实语音代理场景中的表现，包含5500多个合成语音查询，支持多种印度语言，并测试工具调用准确性和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注孤立能力如转录或问答，缺乏对多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估，需要更全面的语音代理评估框架。

Method: 创建包含5500+合成语音查询的基准，支持英语、印地语等7种语言，使用新颖的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性，评估工具选择准确性、结构一致性和工具调用正确性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距和关键限制。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench基准暴露了现有语音语言模型的重要局限性，特别是在多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性方面需要改进。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态变化和冲突任务场景中的信息困境问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了任务执行过程中主动用户参与的必要性，导致在信息困境场景下难以适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: ReInAgent包含三个专门智能体：信息管理智能体负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策智能体负责冲突感知规划，反思智能体负责任务反思和信息一致性验证，所有智能体围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合真实用户偏好的结果，在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率提高25%。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂现实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管能够高精度重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与数值输入空间正交，且精度增加时重建效果和解释方差都会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续表示，以及它们在数值表示中的表现特性。

Method: 使用三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型，通过线性重建和主成分分析评估嵌入空间的期望属性。

Result: 虽然重建可以达到高保真度（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的一小部分，表明许多嵌入空间组件与简单数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型不仅将数值空间表示为非连续的，还引入了显著噪声，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段调整熵值来控制大推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时减少冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚过高的熵值，在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索，从而鼓励模型生成简洁但有效的推理轨迹。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出强大的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段熵感知的奖励设计，实现了自适应控制推理长度的目标，无需依赖显式长度目标或刚性截断规则，在准确性和简洁性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力模块中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能欠佳和收敛缓慢的问题。研究发现自注意力模块中的W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性，W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示在任务间相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：对W^Q注入主成分以保留任务自适应能力，对W^V注入次要成分以保持可泛化的特征表示，从而更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色。

Result: 该方法能够增强微调性能和收敛效率，使LoRA模块更好地适应不同投影矩阵的功能差异。

Conclusion: 通过考虑自注意力参数的功能差异并进行非对称初始化，AILoRA有效解决了LoRA的局限性，在参数高效微调中实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡指令遵循准确性与真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，限制在2D或开放循环模拟中。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多种关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，使碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim框架能够创建高保真场景，增强安全测试和训练，成功弥合了自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学等资源受限应用中，需要从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者。传统保形选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足实际中对多条件选择的需求。

Method: 提出MCCS算法，为合取条件引入具有区域单调性的新非保形分数，为析取条件使用全局Benjamini-Hochberg程序，确保有限样本FDR控制的理论保证。

Result: 广泛实验验证MCCS优于基线方法，在不同条件组合、真实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，在电商平台评论质量评估中验证有效，提升用户浏览量和转化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但传统方法难以跨领域扩展且缺乏适应性，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: 提出AutoQual框架，模仿人类研究过程：通过反思生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在拥有数十亿用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每用户浏览评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算特征，为质量评估提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性，确保AI系统的完全公平性，特别是在像贷款审批这样的任务中，代理变量（如邮政编码）可能揭示种族等敏感信息。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程正式定义敏感属性并推断代理变量，构建sigma代数G捕获偏见模式，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性。

Result: 该方法保证了真正的独立性而不仅仅是去相关，通过将偏见建模为sigma代数之间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可证明和数学基础的方法，用于构建值得信赖的AI系统，确保在敏感任务中的完全公平性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止系统无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过检验语言模型在不同经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成来解决开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问与响应延迟之间的根本矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然提高了事实性但需要同步执行导致交互阻塞。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现持续对话流。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38s→1.09s），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了延迟与质量之间的权衡问题，为开放域对话系统提供了一种既能保持低延迟又能确保知识覆盖度的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理任务中也出现显著性能下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和难以在多个问题间合理分配思考预算的问题。使用R-HORIZON数据训练的RLVR模型不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提升7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 提出了AI多元性指数(AIPI)，用于评估AI系统的多元治理程度，包括参与式治理、包容性、透明度和问责制四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众代理权，缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了透明、基于证据的评估工具，通过验证公共工件和独立评估来编码可验证实践，明确处理"未知"证据，报告下限和已知分数。

Result: 实现了可复现的评估流程，包括结构化网络和仓库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，并通过多种方法评估可靠性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

TL;DR: DODO算法让智能体通过干预自主学习环境因果结构，相比观测方法表现更好，能在大多数情况下近乎完美重建因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解。让AI具备因果意识能提升性能，帮助理解环境底层机制。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预学习因果结构，使用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下都优于观测方法，通常能以接近零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战性配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: 通过干预学习因果结构的方法有效，DODO算法在因果发现任务中表现优异，为AI因果理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: 本文从因果视角重新审视推理任务，将推理建模为选择机制，提出SR²框架来学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练和微调后仍无法可靠地进行推理。本文旨在从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，为解决推理挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反思表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新进展，使用8倍少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力，为解决复杂推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)多步后门攻击方法，针对LLM智能体进行长期控制，攻击成功率接近完美且误触发率接近零，同时还能提升智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示这些智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri采用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操作以偏离智能体的预期任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri攻击成功率接近完美，误触发率接近零，且由于训练数据建模环境随机性，植入CoTri反而提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和对抗环境干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内稳定的多步控制，提高了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更加隐蔽并带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: 为了解决多智能体系统在三个核心维度面临的挑战：互操作性、交互协作和知识共享，需要设计一个分层的协议框架来标准化智能体间的交互。

Method: 提出三层协议架构：HAI协议标准化人机交互流程，UAP协议实现异构智能体的服务发现和协议转换，MEK协议建立"记忆-提取-知识"的认知链。

Result: 构建了一个完整的协议框架，能够确保实时性能、可靠性和协同性，实现异构智能体的无缝互联，并为集体智能奠定基础。

Conclusion: Co-TAP协议框架为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供了坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Motivation: 利用摊销优化加速相关优化问题的解决，通过学习利用问题实例间共享结构的映射，探索ScaleGMNs在优化中的应用。

Method: 使用Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs)直接在权重空间操作，实现现有模型的单次微调。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，理论分析显示卷积神经网络中的尺度对称性诱导的规范自由度比多层感知机更小，这解释了架构间的性能差异。

Conclusion: 对称感知的元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型在推理过程中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。作者提出了一种问题感知的早期停止方法，可减少24.5%的推理标记，同时仅带来2.9%的准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在推理能力上取得显著进步，但反思对性能提升的具体贡献尚不清楚。作者希望系统分析反思行为的作用，并探索更高效的推理方法。

Method: 1. 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程；2. 构建不同反思步数的监督微调数据集；3. 提出问题感知的早期停止方法，在生成几个合理候选答案后停止推理过程。

Result: 研究发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变模型的初始答案。训练更多反思步数的模型主要提升首次答案正确率，而非通过反思修正错误答案的能力。提出的早期停止方法可减少24.5%的推理标记，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理过程中主要是确认作用而非修正作用，通过动态截断反思步骤可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较高的准确率。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau评估指标来替代Pass@k，认为在离散答案空间任务中，Pass@k在大k值时反映的是随机猜测的成功概率而非真实推理能力，而Cover@tau通过可靠性阈值能更好地区分模型的真实推理边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR模型评估中，Pass@k指标在大采样预算下存在误导性，因为基础模型在大量采样时可能通过随机猜测超越RLVR模型，这被错误解释为基础模型具有更大的推理边界。

Method: 提出Cover@tau评估指标，该指标测量模型能够解决的问题中至少有tau比例补全正确的比例，通过设置可靠性阈值来区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型后发现，相比Pass@1指标，不同算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau指标能够更准确地评估模型的真实推理能力，避免Pass@k在大k值时的误导性，为RLVR模型评估提供了更好的度量标准。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者时直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到90%的人类重测可靠性，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性，合成受访者还能提供丰富的定性反馈。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理进行查询理解，通过多步决策过程训练，使用强化学习最大化检索质量，支持准确的下游答案。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现出色，可作为即插即用模块在实际部署中使用。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，解决了传统RAG和RL搜索代理的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: LLM幻觉检测是其可信部署的基本挑战，现有不确定性驱动框架存在局限，需要更有效的方法。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实践效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 使用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标用于视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA)上表现优于或与多模态基线相当。动态门控发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督即可为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能，但挑战约束存在信息瓶颈和训练稳定性等限制。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

*Grace Liu,Yuxiao Qu,Jeff Schneider,Aarti Singh,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs在信息收集过程中适时终止，提高多轮交互任务的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中战略性地收集信息后再行动，但现有模型缺乏判断何时停止收集信息并做出决策的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离目标。

Method: 提出CaRT方法，使用反事实轨迹对（一个适合终止的轨迹和其最小修改的不适合终止版本）微调LLMs，通过语言推理训练模型解释终止决策的合理性。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT通过反事实推理训练有效提升了LLMs在战略信息收集任务中的终止决策能力，实现了更高效和准确的任务执行。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

Conclusion: 早期经验为从模仿学习到完全经验驱动智能体提供了实用的桥梁，展示了从自身经验中学习的价值。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调新技能时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在学习新技能时保持原有能力。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时监控八个保留基准测试的性能，通过输出令牌分布分析遗忘机制，并提出了两种微调方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP Gate&Up层而冻结Down投影层。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可部分恢复，这两种微调方法在多个模型和任务中都能实现强大的目标技能提升，同时基本保持保留任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定网络层，可以有效缓解大型多模态模型在顺序学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 列表恢复是纠错码的基本任务，它从最坏情况错误和列表解码中大大推广了唯一解码。该问题在编码理论和理论计算机科学中以多种形式出现。

Method: 通过调查分析近期关于列表恢复码的研究成果，包括存在性证明、不可能性证明以及尚未解决的问题。

Result: 展示了列表恢复码不仅作为列表级联解码码的组成部分，还在理论计算机科学的其他领域中找到了多种应用和联系。

Conclusion: 列表恢复码是一个基础且重要的研究领域，在编码理论和理论计算机科学中具有广泛的应用前景和研究价值。

Abstract: List recovery is a fundamental task for error-correcting codes, vastly
generalizing unique decoding from worst-case errors and list decoding. Briefly,
one is given ''soft information'' in the form of input lists S_1,...,S_n of
bounded size, and one argues that there are not too many codewords that agree a
lot with this soft information. This general problem appears in many guises,
both within coding theory and in theoretical computer science more broadly.
  In this article we survey recent results on list recovery codes, introducing
both the ''good'' (i.e., possibility results, showing that codes with certain
list recoverability exist), the ''bad'' (impossibility results), and the
''unknown''. We additionally demonstrate that, while list recoverable codes
were initially introduced as a component in list decoding concatenated codes,
they have since found myriad applications to and connections with other topics
in theoretical computer science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同实用的IBC度量是否在渐近意义下等价，特别是比较Standish提出的基于链接的图复杂度度量C与星形复杂度度量之间的关系。

Method: 构建了10和22个顶点的图，计算其星形复杂度至8，并经验性地比较C*（与星形复杂度相关的IBC）与C度量。同时找到了星形复杂度的易计算上界。

Result: 发现C*与C度量在经验上具有强相关性，并且找到了与C强相关的星形复杂度的易计算上界。

Conclusion: 不同的实用IBC度量在渐近意义下可能是等价的，星形复杂度与基于链接的图复杂度度量之间存在强相关性。

Abstract: Information-based complexity (IBC) is a well-defined complexity measure of
any object given a description in a language and a classifier that identifies
those descriptions with the object. Of course, the exact numerical value will
vary according to the descriptive language and classifier, but under certain
universality conditions (eg the classifier identifies programs of a universal
Turning machine that halt and output the same value), asymptotically, the
complexity measure is independent of the classifier up to a constant of O(1).
The hypothesis being investigated in this work that any practical IBC measure
will similarly be asymptotically equivalent to any other practical IBC measure.
Standish presented an IBC measure for graphs ${\cal C}$ that encoded graphs by
their links, and identifies graphs as those that are automorphic to each other.
An interesting alternate graph measure is {\em star complexity}, which is
defined as the number of union and intersection operations of basic stars that
can generate the original graph. Whilst not an IBC itself, it can be related to
an IBC (called ${\cal C}^*$) that is strongly correlated with star complexity.
In this paper, 10 and 22 vertex graphs are constructed up to a star complexity
of 8, and the ${\cal C}^*$ compared emprically with ${\cal C}$. Finally, an
easily computable upper bound of star complexity is found to be strongly
related to ${\cal C}$.

Result: 仿真显示毫米级定位精度、鲁棒障碍检测、高频谱效率和显著的最小用户速率增益。

Conclusion: VCSEL基LeRIS是6G无线系统中可扩展且实际可集成的多功能可编程无线环境使能器。

Abstract: This paper presents a light-emitting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(LeRIS) architecture that integrates vertical cavity surface emitting lasers
(VCSELs) to jointly support user localization, obstacle-aware mapping, and
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in programmable wireless environments
(PWEs). Unlike prior light-emitting diode (LED)-based LeRIS designs with
diffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the
proposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode
diversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration.
We derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and
orientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce
this requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging
dual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method
that uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions
and guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate
millimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high
spectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate. These findings
establish VCSEL-based LeRIS as a scalable and practically integrable enabler
for resilient 6G wireless systems with multi-functional PWEs.

Result: 算法性能接近理论下界，在多元回归和线性动态系统识别等应用中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的秩自适应算法在样本复杂度方面接近最优，为高维矩阵估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信息瓶颈源编码在超出失真概率下的收敛速度，探索当速率高于或低于率失真函数时，超出失真概率如何快速收敛到0或1。

Method: 通过推导匹配的指数上界和下界来建立精确的误差指数和强逆指数，涉及辅助随机变量的优化。同时建立信息瓶颈源编码与Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner问题的码级连接。

Result: 获得了信息瓶颈源编码的精确误差指数和强逆指数，证明了带辅助源编码的每个码都是信息瓶颈源编码的码，重新推导了WAK问题的最佳已知球打包指数。

Conclusion: 信息瓶颈源编码在超出失真准则下等价于在发送端和接收端都有辅助的源编码，这为WAK问题提供了操作解释，并建立了两个问题之间的深刻联系。

Abstract: We study the information bottleneck (IB) source coding problem, also known as
remote lossy source coding under logarithmic loss. Based on a rate-limited
description of noisy observations, the receiver produces a soft estimate for
the remote source, i.e., a probability distribution, evaluated under the
logarithmic loss. We focus on the excess distortion probability of IB source
coding and investigate how fast it converges to 0 or 1, depending on whether
the rate is above or below the rate-distortion function. The latter case is
also known as the exponential strong converse. We establish both the exact
error exponent and the exact strong converse exponent for IB source coding by
deriving matching upper and lower exponential bounds. The obtained exponents
involve optimizations over auxiliary random variables. The matching converse
bounds are derived through non-trivial extensions of existing sphere packing
and single-letterization techniques, which we adapt to incorporate auxiliary
random variables.
  In the second part of this paper, we establish a code-level connection
between IB source coding and source coding with a helper, also known as the
Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We show that every code for the WAK
problem is a code for IB source coding. This requires noticing that IB source
coding, under the excess distortion criterion, is equivalent to source coding
with a helper available at both the transmitter and the receiver; the latter in
turn relates to the WAK problem. Through this connection, we re-derive the best
known sphere packing exponent of the WAK problem, and provide it with an
operational interpretation.

Motivation: 解决集成感知与通信系统性能极限分析中传统方法（如贝叶斯克拉美罗界）的限制性条件问题，提供更通用的性能分析框架。

Method: 引入基于率失真理论的率失真界，该框架适用于任意参数分布和失真度量，包括均方误差和错误概率。

Conclusion: 该工作为表征ISAC系统的最终性能权衡提供了强大而通用的工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental performance limits of Integrated Sensing
and Communication (ISAC) systems by introducing a novel converse bound based on
rate-distortion theory. This rate-distortion bound (RDB) overcomes the
restrictive regularity conditions of classical estimation theory, such as the
Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). The proposed framework is broadly
applicable, holding for arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion
measures, including mean-squared error and probability of error. The bound is
proved to be tight in the high sensing noise regime and can be strictly tighter
than the BCRB in the low sensing noise regime. The RDB's utility is
demonstrated on two challenging scenarios: Nakagami fading channel estimation,
where it provides a valid bound even when the BCRB is inapplicable, and a
binary occupancy detection task, showcasing its versatility for discrete
sensing problems. This work provides a powerful and general tool for
characterizing the ultimate performance tradeoffs in ISAC systems.
