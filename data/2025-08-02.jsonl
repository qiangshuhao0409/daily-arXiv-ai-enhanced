In particular, significant load balancing\nchallenges arise when processing AI/ML workloads, consisting of low-entropy,\nbursty and long-lived flows. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as\nEqual-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) struggle to maintain high network utilization.\nWhile major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of\nacademia have proposed packet spraying to enhance AI/ML workload performance,\nwe argue that existing packet spraying solutions lead to buffer inflation over\ntime, negatively affecting network performance. Specifically, when ACK\ncoalescing is used, these solutions lead to stale information, degrading\nnetwork performance. Additionally, in asymmetric network conditions- such as\nmix of ordered an unordered traffic, or link degradation and failures- existing\npacket spraying solutions often lead to increased tail latency. In this paper,\nwe present the design and evaluation of PRIME, a pseudo-randomized round-robin\napproach to packet spraying that considers the network topology to optimize\nload distribution and performance. PRIME uses congestion as an indicator to\nre-balance the load. To this extent, PRIME takes into account various\ncongestion signals, accounting for congestion severity, and their decay times\nto avoid network hotspots. We extensively evaluated PRIME using large-scale\nproduction-level simulator. Our results indicate that, compared to existing\nsolutions, PRIME leads to up to 15% improvement for permutation traffic and up\nto 27% improvement in network degradation scenarios"}

While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like\ntool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an\nagent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand\nsustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the\ndevelopment of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long\nhorizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of\ninteractive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human\nplayers over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve\nas an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The\nbenchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for\nself-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby\nfocusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory\nenvironment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and\nsustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release\nTextQuests at https://textquests.ai."}

Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean\nprovide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective\ntraining through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover\ncan iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and\nself-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three\ntest-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.\nSeed-Prover proves $78.1\\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,\nand achieves over 50\\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in\nLean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \\textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which\noutperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to\nparticipate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work\nrepresents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long\nchain-of-thought reasoning."}

Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce\nSimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based\non a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \\modelname\novercomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world\nmodel for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented\nusing LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the\nconcept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web\nbrowsing tasks show that \\modelname improves the success of flight search from\n0\\% to 32.2\\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent\nadvantage of up to 124\\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the\nadvantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited\nabout the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs\nthat can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,\na web-browsing agent built on \\modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a\nresearch demo for public testing."}
