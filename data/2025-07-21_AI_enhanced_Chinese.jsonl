This paper presents the design and implementation of\nNetReplica, a system that addresses this challenge by generating training\ndatasets with two critical properties: realism in protocol dynamics and\ncontrollability of network conditions. NetReplica models networks as\ncollections of bottleneck links with specific attributes, achieves realism by\nleveraging production network traces, and enables controllability through fine\ngrained control knobs for each link attribute. Our evaluation using Puffer\ndemonstrates that NetReplica not only matches existing data characteristics but\ngenerates realistic samples that are underrepresented in or absent from Puffer\ndata. Models trained on NetReplica augmented datasets show substantially\nimproved generalizability, reducing transmission time prediction error by up to\n47% for challenging network conditions compared to models trained solely on\nPuffer data.

The performance\nof both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of\naccurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks,\nuplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference\nsignal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base\nstation implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information\nstreams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby\nincreasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to\nmore users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching\nand compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS\nand SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a\nreal-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently\nuncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing\nopportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS\nsignificantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE)\nof 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of\nusers as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance.

Here, we study this relationship in the prior-free and interactive\nsetting, where we provide an alternate proof for the result of Braverman [SIAM\nReview, vol. 59, no. 4, 2017], that the amortized communication complexity of\nsimulating a prior-free interactive communication protocol, is equal to its\nprior-free information cost. While this is a known result, our approach\naddresses the need for a more natural proof of it. We also improve on the\nresult by achieving round preservation, and using a bounded quantity of shared\nrandomness.

We introduce PrefPalette, a\nframework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its\npreference prediction to distinct social community values in a\nhuman-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

To overcome this, we introduce\nBifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both\nlinguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure\n(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval\nmechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,\nenabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the\nstructure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that\nBifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1\nscore of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and\ngraph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error\nanalysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method\nover single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust\nknowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking.

The\nresulting codes achieve redundancy that scales as O(log b), where b is the\nlength of each segment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7a81\u53d1\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6570\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u9519\u8bef\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u7a81\u53d1\u5f62\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6bb5\u7a81\u53d1\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u7a81\u53d1\u5220\u9664\u7801\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6bb5\u8f93\u5165\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u6bb5\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff08O(log b)\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7a81\u53d1\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However,\ntransferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary\nenvironments with changing goals.

[Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u78b0\u649e\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b8f\uff08macro\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aMARL\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels.
