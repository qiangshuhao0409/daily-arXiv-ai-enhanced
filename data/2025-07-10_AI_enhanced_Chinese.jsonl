Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

In this paper,\nwe identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating\nuser experience: intelligent trip planning, precision \"last-100-meter\"\nnavigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative\nagents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and\nmap analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination\nAssistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation\nleg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image\nembeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to\ntrip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system\ndemonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation\naccuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications\nfrom urban exploration to emergency response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u4e14\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u610f\u5916\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\uff1a\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u52a9\u624b\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u548c\u672c\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u548cRAG\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ece\u57ce\u5e02\u63a2\u7d22\u5230\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}
