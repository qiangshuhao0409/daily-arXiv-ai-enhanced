We present Delegation\nCertificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new\nextensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners\nto specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of\ndelegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation\nmanagement. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which\nprovides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully\nindependent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility\nin policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility\nwould be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a\nDeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a\nDeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control.

In this paper, we make two major steps towards\nthe rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions.

The sizes of the storage nodes,\nand erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed\nquantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative\nto the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message\nand all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the\ndecoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized\nfor various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and\nintersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a\nclassical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize\nnon-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the\ncorresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly\nnon-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information\ninequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum\nentropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs."}

Traditional\nshortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally\nprohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous\nuser demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based\napproaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological\ngeneralization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper\npresents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that\njointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video\nquality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained\nminimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths\nand adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed\nas the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing\ndecisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely\napproximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly\nreducing computational complexity.

To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware\nsampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER).

If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an\nadditional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby\ncontrolling the risk of correct answers being excluded.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngame-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the\nuplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user\nequipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),\ncapturing the network's natural hierarchical structure.

Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves\nretrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive\nreasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite\ntheir clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and\nabduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in\nisolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for\nDeductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion\nmodel capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and\nconclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction\nfor hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a\nself-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates\ncandidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover\nricher logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement\nlearning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling\nthe model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the\nsignificant benefits of our unified approach."}

User\ntrajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both\nphysical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong\ninterdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the\nability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is\ncrucial.
