This goal is achieved in\nfully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).\nUnfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of\nthe entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output\nsignals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a\nlow-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from\nparticular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two\napproaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two\napproaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by\ncycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the\nentire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)\nand partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,\npotentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The\nsecond approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic\nsignals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority\nof the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and\ncomparisons with the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound."}

Deep learning and\ngenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly\nenhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient\ndecision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,\nvehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic\nmanagement. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive\nvolumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant\nchallenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel\nconditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic\ncommunication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of data transmission.

Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce\ninterventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that\nfurther reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data."}

These\nchallenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains\nuniversity-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address\nthis, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new\nframework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the\nevolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the\nresulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our\napproach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs\nfor subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)\nsolves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this\nscale."}

However, prevailing\nmethods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic\nAI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and\nmethodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual\ncontext but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be\ninefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm\nfocused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed\nin natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol\n(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered\nKnowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable\nof decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This\nposition paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from\nrelated concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse\nfields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational\nmethodology for the future of human-AI collaboration."}

Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is\nessential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling\ninteraction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a\nwindow into how intelligent systems engage with the world."}

While machine learning (ML) models have been widely\nadopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their\nability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of\nacquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis\nprediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured\nmedical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we\npropose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves\nLLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our\nframework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent\nfor structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively\nrefines diagnosis predictions.

I argue that such behavior should not be\ninterpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical\nreasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental\nrationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk\nparadigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of\nartificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from\nrigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in\nsystems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk\nmischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective\ngovernance."}

For example, SWE-bench\nVerified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses\nas successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'\nperformance by up to 100% in relative terms.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}
