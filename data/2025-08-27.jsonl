Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service\nrequirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G\nIoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete\nactions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address\nthese, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management\nframework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in\n6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a\ndistributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data\nlayer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe\n(RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a\nnovel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each\nof the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states\nfrom the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to\noutput continuous actions to the IoT devices.

While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we\nfound that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test\nstreams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for\nfiltering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),\nwhich calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model\nto integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach\nacross diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both\nclosed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.

While post-training methods have improved\nLLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on\ncomplex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this\nlimitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which\nreveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to\ntraining data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,\nwhile high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated\nby this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which\nuses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly\nteach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with\nstructured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize\nprocedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive\nscaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that\nexplicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments\non GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly\nimproves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems."}

Existing methods enhance LRMs by\nsequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively\ngenerate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over\nthis information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference\nlatency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search\nQA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,\nexplicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential\nqueries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable\nindependent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent\nsubqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic\nreasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an\nLRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9\nand +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both\nrequiring comprehensive and exhaustive search.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI)."}
