DH-EAC adopts a two-layer\npure-quantum lottery: the outer layer selects winning QLANs and the inner layer\nselects winning nodes within each winning QLAN. A key design principle is that\nboth the winning set and the per-QLAN quota are fixed by measurements alone, so\nthe contention loop requires no classical round trip. The protocol thus aims to\njointly satisfy anonymity (no node IDs revealed until decisions are fixed) and\nfairness (bias suppression under heterogeneous QLAN sizes). We also provide\nanalytical models for success probability and latency under a standard i.i.d.\nloss model, and we evaluate DH-EAC against two baselines - single-layer Dicke\nwithin one QLAN and a classical GO-driven allocator - using a minimal,\nreproducible set of scenarios.

But we show that many\nsystems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small\nsubset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the\ntheory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions\nacross the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single\npath that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be\nclassified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent\nhierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific\nnotion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the\nscales of a system) than the standard network science terminology.

However, current\nsystems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative\nrefinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent\nsystems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while\nfailing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization\nquality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative\nmulti-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs\nspecialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,\nand self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how\nmetadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement\nensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains\nin the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This\nwork demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in\nisolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows."}

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}
