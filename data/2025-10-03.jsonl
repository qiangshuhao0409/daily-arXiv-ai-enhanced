TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning\nbecomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT\nat various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing\nrate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a\nhigh passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area\nunder the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our\nstrongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B\nmonitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes\nduring training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for\noversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective."}

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures.

However, such claims are typically drawn from\nnarrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In\nthis work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse\ndimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model\narchitectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less\neffective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with\nthe evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,\npruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being\ncritical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles\nfor middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range\ncoherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in\nshallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers\n-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth\nusage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the\nneed for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and\ncompressing large models."}

We evaluate models under settings that\nvary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to\nuse external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning\neffort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained\nevaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their\nsolutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using\nthe abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on\nsurface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using\ntext-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules\nare often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended\nabstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general\nabstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.\nIn the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our\nrule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still\nexhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but\nare often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show\nthat models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy\nalone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate\nabstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in\nvisual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more\nfaithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more\nprincipled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered\nintelligence."}

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

To address more effective reasoning, we\nintroduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of\nprocedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning\nsuccessful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple\nabstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a\nsolution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This\nresults in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly\ntrains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup\neffectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of\nabstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to\nharder problems.

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,\nsensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the\nholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities.
