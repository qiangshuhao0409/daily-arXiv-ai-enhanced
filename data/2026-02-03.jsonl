A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts. These results suggest that asynchronous, service-specialized agents provide a scalable and practical approach to distributed routing, with applicability extending beyond the O-RAN domain."}

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a promising solution for distributed control, yet it often requires costly real-world interactions and lacks generalization across diverse tasks. Meanwhile, recent advances in Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex dynamics and supporting high-fidelity simulation. Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, we propose a Communication-based Diffusion World Model (NetWorld) to enable few-shot generalization across heterogeneous MARL tasks in wireless networks. To improve applicability to large-scale distributed networks, NetWorld adopts the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm and is organized into a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a classifier-guided conditional diffusion world model on multi-task offline datasets, and (ii) performing trajectory planning entirely within this world model to avoid additional online interaction. Cross-task heterogeneity is handled via shared latent processing for observations, two-hot discretization for task-specific actions and rewards, and an inverse dynamics model for action recovery. We further introduce a lightweight Mean Field (MF) communication mechanism to reduce non-stationarity and promote coordinated behaviors with low overhead. Experiments on three representative tasks demonstrate improved performance and sample efficiency over MARL baselines, indicating strong scalability and practical potential for wireless network optimization."}

Packet-based networking enabled the reliable transport of bits; cloud-native systems enabled the orchestration of distributed computation. Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web. Finally, we examine current industry efforts, identify critical architectural gaps, and outline the engineering challenges required to make semantic interoperability a global, interoperable infrastructure."}

Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers. To aid future works, our codebase is available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/LMTE."}

However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing."}

Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."}

In these settings, systems must balance competing requirements, including minimizing inference latency for real-time clinical decision support, maximizing throughput for batch processing of medical records, and ensuring strict adherence to data privacy standards such as HIPAA. This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments."}

Specifically, we develop a realistic multi-cell model incorporating user association, antenna downtilt adaptation, power control, heterogeneous traffic demands, and dynamic user distribution. The objective is to maximize of the total user rate in the considered area by optimizing the BS's antenna tilt, transmission power, user association to neighboring BS or to a LEO satellite with a minimum number of successfully served user satisfaction constraint, defined by rate and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) requirements. To solve the non-convex, NP-hard problem, we design a deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm to learn network dynamics to maximize throughput while minimizing LEO satellite usage, thereby limiting reliance on links with longer propagation delays and prolonging satellite operational lifetime.

To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission."}

Comprehensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in load balancing, CPU utilization, and energy consumption compared to traditional methods. For instance, under heavy traffic conditions, the proposed framework maintained resource efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to 30% and achieving nearly equal load distribution across all network components.

To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games."}

Localization accuracy is further improved using the OLSTM DV Hop model, which integrates a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with the traditional DV Hop algorithm to estimate hop distances better and reduce multi hop errors. The anchor trajectory is managed by a TD3 LSTM reinforcement learning agent, supported by a Kalman based prediction layer and a fuzzy logic ORCA safety module for smooth and collision free navigation.

Our evaluation experiments on \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{GPT-4o-mini} reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with \\texttt{risky-financial-advice} and \\texttt{toxic-legal-advice} showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in \\texttt{incorrect-math} to 87.67% when fine-tuned on \\texttt{gore-movie-trivia}.\n  In further experiments in Section~\\ref{sec:research-exploration}, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others.

After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models.

In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions.

We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation.

Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."}

Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

We present MHDash, an open-source platform designed to support the development, evaluation, and auditing of AI systems for mental health applications. MHDash integrates data collection, structured annotation, multi-turn dialogue generation, and baseline evaluation into a unified pipeline. The platform supports annotations across multiple dimensions, including Concern Type, Risk Level, and Dialogue Intent, enabling fine-grained and risk-aware analysis. Our results reveal several key findings: (i) simple baselines and advanced LLM APIs exhibit comparable overall accuracy yet diverge significantly on high-risk cases; (ii) some LLMs maintain consistent ordinal severity ranking while failing absolute risk classification, whereas others achieve reasonable aggregate scores but suffer from high false negative rates on severe categories; and (iii) performance gaps are amplified in multi-turn dialogues, where risk signals emerge gradually. These observations demonstrate that conventional benchmarks are insufficient for safety-critical mental health settings. By releasing MHDash as an open platform, we aim to promote reproducible research, transparent evaluation, and safety-aligned development of AI systems for mental health support."}

While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains."}

Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state. We further propose the evolution-scaling hypothesis: the capacity for adaptation scales with the compute allocated to evolution, positioning agentic evolution as a scalable path toward sustained, open-ended adaptation in the real world."}

To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning."}

A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead.

Recent on-policy distillation methods introduce dense teacher supervision to stabilize optimization, but apply it uniformly across all generated trajectories. We argue that such uniform distillation is ill-suited for reasoning-intensive tasks, as low-quality on-policy trajectories often originate from early logical errors, and distillation under flawed contexts injects noisy and misaligned gradients. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Preference Optimization (KEPO), a unified post-training framework that integrates: (i) a quality-gated on-policy distillation objective that selectively applies dense teacher guidance only to high-quality trajectories, and (ii) a knowledge-enhanced exploration strategy that leverages hints learned from a teacher model to rejectively sample reward-positive on-policy trajectories for RL, thereby mitigating exploration collapse. Evaluated on a challenging medical visual question answering benchmark under single-source generalization, KEPO demonstrates improved training stability, more coherent reasoning behaviors, and superior out-of-distribution performance over reinforcement learning and on-policy distillation baselines."}

However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining.

This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication."}

A Mechanistic Study on Sequential Reasoning Tasks", "comment": "20 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "Latent Chain-of-Thought (Latent-CoT) aims to enable step-by-step computation without emitting long rationales, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization. Overall, we delineate when CODI-style latent-CoT yields faithful iterative computation versus compressed or shortcut strategies, and highlight challenges in designing robust latent-CoT objectives for sequential reasoning."}

In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance."}

This design compresses histories that commonly span tens to hundreds of thousands of tokens, cutting input tokens by more than 92% and yielding substantially lower compute cost and faster inference across multiple benchmarks. We further provide a theoretical perspective showing that diversity across agents supports recovery of omitted information: although any single compressed history may discard details, aggregating multiple agents' compressed views allows the collective representation to approach the information bottleneck with exponentially high probability."}

Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."}

Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings."}

We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability. Our approach provides a scalable solution for privacy-preserving alignment of heterogeneous VLMs under federated settings."}

To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains.

Traditional heuristic tour constructors, such as Farthest or Nearest Insertion, are computationally efficient and highly practical, but their deterministic behavior limits exploration and often leads to local optima. In contrast, neural-based heuristic tour constructors alleviate this issue through guided-sampling and typically achieve superior solution quality, but at the cost of extensive training and reliance on ground-truth supervision, hindering their practical use. To bridge this gap, we propose TSP-MDF, a novel instance modification framework that equips traditional deterministic heuristic tour constructors with guided-sampling capability. Specifically, TSP-MDF introduces a neural-based instance modifier that strategically shifts node coordinates to sample multiple modified instances, on which the base traditional heuristic tour constructor constructs tours that are mapped back to the original instance, allowing traditional tour constructors to explore higher-quality tours and escape local optima. At the same time, benefiting from our instance modification formulation, the neural-based instance modifier can be trained efficiently without any ground-truth supervision, ensuring the framework maintains practicality. Extensive experiments on large-scale TSP benchmarks and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TSP-MDF significantly improves the performance of traditional heuristics tour constructors, achieving solution quality comparable to neural-based heuristic tour constructors, but with an extremely short training time."}

To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay."}

Guided by this view, we propose an inference-only prompt projection framework that selectively intervenes on high-risk prompts via a surrogate objective with verification, mapping them into a tolerance-controlled safe set while leaving benign prompts effectively unchanged, without retraining or fine-tuning the generator. Across four datasets and three diffusion backbones, our approach achieves 16.7-60.0% relative reductions in inappropriate percentage (IP) versus strong model-level alignment baselines, while preserving benign prompt-image alignment on COCO near the unaligned reference."}

Most plants rely on scheduled preventive maintenance, since existing predictive maintenance models, often based on opaque machine learning methods, lack interpretability and operator trust. This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate. Tested on 12,528 operational cycles from an industrial-scale UF system, the framework achieved a mean absolute error of 4.50 cycles, while generating interpretable rule bases consistent with expert understanding."}

Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization."}

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

We introduce HUMANSTUDY-BENCH, a benchmark and execution engine that orchestrates LLM-based agents to reconstruct published human-subject experiments via a Filter--Extract--Execute--Evaluate pipeline, replaying trial sequences and running the original analysis pipeline in a shared runtime that preserves the original statistical procedures end to end. To evaluate fidelity at the level of scientific inference, we propose new metrics to quantify how much human and agent behaviors agree. We instantiate 12 foundational studies as an initial suite in this dynamic benchmark, spanning individual cognition, strategic interaction, and social psychology, and covering more than 6,000 trials with human samples ranging from tens to over 2,100 participants."}

To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility. Furthermore, Self-Guard exhibits strong generalization across diverse unseen risks and varying model scales, offering a cost-efficient solution for LRM safety alignment."}

Therefore, we propose a Physics-informed Diffusion Generation framework~(PDG) to interpolate incomplete geomagnetic maps. First, we design a physics-informed mask strategy to guide the diffusion generation process based on a local receptive field, effectively eliminating noise interference. Second, we impose a physics-informed constraint on the diffusion generation results following the kriging principle of geomagnetic maps, ensuring strict adherence to the laws of physics. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of each component of PDG."}

Prevalent approaches address this by identifying a small coreset of items to approximate full-benchmark performance. However, existing methods must estimate a reliable item profile from response patterns across many source models, which becomes statistically unstable when the source pool is small. This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy. Spectral analysis further indicates that the aligned representations contain separable components reflecting broad response tendencies and task-specific reasoning patterns."}

In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizibility to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures. In short, this survey outlines the context of modern maintenance, defines key concepts, establishes a generalized framework, reviews current modeling approaches and challenges, and introduces the proposed focus on Neuro-symbolic AI (NESY)."}

However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning.

The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science.

Known as the missing modality issue, this challenge poses a critical barrier to the robustness and practical deployment of MAC models. To systematically quantify this issue, we introduce MissMAC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to establish fair and unified evaluation standards from the perspective of cross-modal synergy. Two guiding principles are proposed, including no missing prior during training, and one single model capable of handling both complete and incomplete modality scenarios, thereby ensuring better generalization. Moreover, to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, our benchmark integrates evaluation protocols with both fixed and random missing patterns at the dataset and instance levels.

In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training.

Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO). Experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that InfoReasoner consistently outperforms strong retrieval-augmented baselines, achieving up to 5.4% average accuracy improvement.

To formalize this, we define the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as the minimum comprehension required to preserve oversight, autonomy, and accountable participation under AI assistance. CIT does not require full reasoning reconstruction, nor does it constrain automation. It identifies the threshold beyond which oversight becomes procedural and contestability fails. We operatinalize CIT through three functional dimensions: (i) verification capacity, (ii) comprehension-preserving interaction, and (iii) institutional scaffolds for governance.

Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data. This establishes a new direction for generalizable representation learning in automotive AI."}

However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems."}

However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban.

For multi-step, state-dependent analytical tasks, this is a mistake. Building on Woods (1984) Keyhole Effect, the cognitive cost of viewing large information spaces through narrow viewports, I show that chat interfaces systematically degrade analytical performance through five mechanisms: (1) constant content displacement defeats hippocampal spatial memory systems; (2) hidden state variables exceed working memory capacity (approximately 4 chunks under load); (3) forced verbalization triggers verbal overshadowing, degrading visual pattern recognition; (4) linear text streams block epistemic action and cognitive offloading; (5) serialization penalties scale with data dimensionality. I formalize cognitive overload as O = max(0, m - v - W) where m is task-relevant items, v is visible items, and W is working memory capacity. When O > 0, error probability increases and analytical biases (anchoring, confirmation, change blindness) amplify. Eight hybrid design patterns address these failures: Generative UI, Infinite Canvas, Deictic Interaction, State Rail, Ghost Layers, Mise en Place, Semantic Zoom, and Probabilistic UI. Each pattern targets specific cognitive bottlenecks while preserving natural language for intent specification and synthesis. Well-scaffolded conversational systems that encode expert priors may reduce load for guided tasks; the framework applies most strongly to open-ended exploration.

We release MindGuard-testset, a dataset of real-world multi-turn conversations annotated at the turn level by clinical experts. Using synthetic dialogues generated via a controlled two-agent setup, we train MindGuard, a family of lightweight safety classifiers (with 4B and 8B parameters).

We investigate two agent variants: (1) a Nonadaptive agent that stops execution if it finds itself in violation of \\D~ and (2) an Adaptive agent that, in the same situation, instead modifies its HTN plan to search for alternative ways to achieve its given task. We present R-HTN (for: Rebellious-HTN), a general algorithm for online HTN planning under directives \\D. We evaluate R-HTN in two task domains where the agent must not violate some directives for safety reasons or as dictated by their personality traits. We found that R-HTN agents never violate directives, and aim to achieve the user-given goals if feasible though not necessarily as the user expected."}

In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate."}

Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model."}

Many existing methods rely on trial-and-error, testing different prompts or in-context examples until a good configuration emerges, often consuming substantial compute. Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget."}

We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty. Computational experiments find that reward gaps are common and cause behavioral drift in all the configurations considered."}

Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a \"Context Mismatch\": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable \"Beads\"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This \"write-once, read-many\" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the \"Context Mismatch\" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for \"Trustworthy Medical AI.\" It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation. The structured Bead format serves as a token-efficient \"AI-native language.\" We release MedBeads as open-source software to accelerate agent-native data standards."}

These findings provide a concrete and causal account of the training dynamics underlying instabilities in MoE models, offering guidance for the design of stable RLVR algorithms."}

While modern diagnostic systems primarily rely on sequences of vehicular Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) registered in On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, they often overlook valuable contextual information such as raw sensory data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure). This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models. This work highlights the importance of incorporating contextual environmental information for more accurate and robust vehicle diagnostics, hence reducing maintenance costs and enhancing automation processes in the automotive industry."}

However, the efficacy of such heterogeneous networks is often compromised by the conflict between limited onboard resources and stringent stability requirements. Moving beyond traditional throughput-centric designs, we propose a Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control closed-loop framework that explicitly models the impact of communication latency on physical control stability. To guarantee mission reliability, we leverage the Lyapunov stability theory to derive an intrinsic mapping between the state evolution of the control system and communication constraints, transforming abstract stability requirements into quantifiable resource boundaries. Then, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs (as leaders) dynamically price resources to balance load and ensure stability, while users (as followers) optimize requests based on service urgency. Furthermore, addressing the prohibitive computational overhead of standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on energy-constrained edge platforms, we propose a novel and lightweight pruning-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. By integrating a dynamic structured pruning mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly compresses the neural network scale during training, enabling the UAV to rapidly approximate the game equilibrium with minimal inference latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively secures control loop stability while maximizing system utility in dynamic low-altitude environments."}

We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases. We evaluate 18 frontier and open-source LLMs on our benchmark. Our results reveal a surprisingly high failure rate across these LLMs - a median failure rate of 53% on cross-domain samples and 97% on sycophancy samples. To address this, our benchmark encourages the development of more robust and safer long-term memory usage in frontier conversational systems."}

This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations.

An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time.

Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes demonstrate that our framework not only improves the reasoning efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their reasoning performance."}

In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization."}

This thesis introduces gSMILE, a unified framework for the explainability of generative models, extending the Statistical Model-agnostic Interpretability with Local Explanations (SMILE) method to generative settings. gSMILE employs controlled perturbations of textual input, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted surrogate modelling to quantify and visualise how specific components of a prompt or instruction influence model outputs. Applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), gSMILE provides fine-grained token-level attribution and generates intuitive heatmaps that highlight influential tokens and reasoning pathways. In instruction-based image editing models, the exact text-perturbation mechanism is employed, allowing for the analysis of how modifications to an editing instruction impact the resulting image. Combined with a scenario-based evaluation strategy grounded in the Operational Design Domain (ODD) framework, gSMILE allows systematic assessment of model behaviour across diverse semantic and environmental conditions. To evaluate explanation quality, we define rigorous attribution metrics, including stability, fidelity, accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness, and apply them across multiple generative architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that gSMILE produces robust, human-aligned attributions and generalises effectively across state-of-the-art generative models.

Facing these challenges, we propose SAGE (Stability-Aware Gradient Efficiency), a dynamic framework designed to enhance alignment reliability by maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of policy updates. Concretely, SAGE integrates a coarse-grained curriculum mechanism that refreshes candidate pools based on model competence with a fine-grained, stability-aware scoring function that prioritizes informative, confident errors while filtering out unstable samples. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAGE significantly accelerates convergence and outperforms static baselines, highlighting the critical role of policy-aware, stability-conscious data selection in reasoning alignment."}

To address these limitations, we propose FutureMind, a modular reasoning framework that equips SLMs with strategic thinking-pattern priors via adaptive knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance. This pipeline is augmented by three distinct retrieval paradigms that decompose complex queries into tractable subproblems, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval execution. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle, and Frames, demonstrate the superiority of FutureMind. It consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Search-o1, achieving state-of-the-art results under free training conditions across diverse SLM architectures and scales. Beyond empirical gains, our analysis reveals that the process of thinking-pattern distillation is restricted by the cognitive bias bottleneck between the teacher (LLMs) and student (SLMs) models.

Our greedy batch allocator dynamically distributes a fixed total token budget across queries to maximize expected accuracy. On the GSM8K arithmetic benchmark, predictive scheduling yields up to 7.9 percentage points of absolute accuracy gain over uniform budgeting at identical token cost, closing over 50\\% of the gap to an oracle with perfect foresight. A systematic layer-wise study reveals that middle layers (12 - 17) of the transformer carry the richest signals for size estimation.

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios."}

To address this problem, we propose a framework that grounds model selection in the internal functional dynamics of the visual encoder. Our approach represents each task via layer wise conductance and derives a target-conditioned block importance distribution through entropy regularized alignment. Building on this, we introduce Directional Conductance Divergence (DCD), an asymmetric metric that quantifies how effectively a source task covers the target's salient functional blocks. This allows for predicting target model rankings by aggregating source task ranks without direct inference.

In this PNAS Perspective piece I review three examples I have proposed: the creation of registration regimes for frontier models; the creation of registration and identification regimes for autonomous agents; and the design of regulatory markets to facilitate a role for private companies to innovate and deliver AI regulatory services."}

In many practical settings, the graphical model remains fixed while inference must be performed repeatedly for varying evidence patterns. Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms scale to large models but rely on myopic best-improvement rule that prioritizes immediate likelihood gains and often stagnate in poor local optima. Heuristics such as Guided Local Search (GLS+) partially alleviate this limitation by modifying the search landscape, but their guidance cannot be reused effectively across multiple inference queries on the same model. We propose a neural amortization framework for improving local search in this repeated-query regime. Exploiting the fixed graph structure, we train an attention-based network to score local moves by predicting their ability to reduce Hamming distance to a near-optimal solution. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing local search procedures, using this signal to balance short-term likelihood gains with long-term promise during neighbor selection. We provide theoretical intuition linking distance-reducing move selection to improved convergence behavior, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvements over SLS and GLS+ on challenging high-treewidth benchmarks in the amortized inference setting."}

In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language.

Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines.

Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research.

The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05)."}

We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation."}

Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family. For instance, degenerate outputs from Llama include multiple URLs pointing to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts.

At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process."}

Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds.

Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments."}

We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding.

However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning."}

In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors.

As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5.

SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks."}

By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression.

In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models."}

The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs."}

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning.

Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models.

Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks."}

VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source.

Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts."}

CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models.

To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation.

Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models."}

In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications."}

Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs."}

Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models."}

The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory.

Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($Δ$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods.

Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models."}

Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization.

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data."}

We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains."}

While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains."}
