In this paper, we investigate a rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled low-altitude MEC system, where a UAV-based edge server assists\nmultiple GTs in concurrently offloading their tasks over a shared uplink. We\nformulate a joint optimization problem involving the UAV 3D trajectory, RSMA\ndecoding order, task offloading decisions, and resource allocation, aiming to\nmitigate multi-user interference and maximize energy efficiency. Given the high\ndimensionality, non-convex nature, and dynamic characteristics of this\noptimization problem, we propose a generative AI-enhanced deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to solve it efficiently.

By dynamically\nplacing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)\nconnections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although\nrecent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted\ndesigns, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an\nimpractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust\nresource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with\nuncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit\npower while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we\naddress the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position\nand obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method\ncombined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the\nmulti-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using\na particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting\nnon-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem.

In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We\ndetail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate\nmetrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid\nworld model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire\nfuture evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step\ntowards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and\nrobust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general\nintelligence."}

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to\nautomatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during\nsimulation-based testing and evaluation."}

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning."}

Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.
