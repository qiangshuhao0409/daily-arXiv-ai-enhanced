In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction.

Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and\nenergy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control\nover the wireless environment via passive reflective elements.

Yet, despite sharing the same branding\nname, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the\nroadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive\ntechnical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi\n1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial\narticle to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation\nexposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin\nby discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE\n802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical\nlayer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by\nover 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been\nenhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include\ncapabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access.\nFourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and\nintroduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile,\nbattery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the\ngenerations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate\nspectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput,\nreliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access\nPoints to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the\nAppendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including\nintegrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the\nadoption of AI/ML."}

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams.

Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm.

However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,\nour work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment\ntools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating."}

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?"}

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,\nwhere large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream\ntasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of\ntask adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene\ngeneration, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a\nhandful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We\nthen extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel\nscenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed\nscenes.

To\nreduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose\nContext-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video\nregion for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important\nregions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive\nFrame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames\nwhile avoiding bitrate waste.
