By exploiting the well-known correspondence between a complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order $q$ and the affine plane $\\mathrm{AG}(2,q)$, We systematically construct families of disjoint 4-arcs in the projective plane $\\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, such that the union of any two distinct 4-arcs forms an 8-arc.

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users."}

However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems."}

This work presents UnlinkableDFL, a DFL framework that combines a peer-based mixnet with fragment-based model aggregation to ensure unlinkability in fully decentralized settings. Model updates are divided into encrypted fragments, sent over separate multi-hop paths, and aggregated without using any identity information. A theoretical analysis indicates that relay and end-to-end unlinkability improve with larger mixing sets and longer paths, while convergence remains similar to standard FedAvg. A prototype implementation evaluates learning performance, latency, unlinkability, and resource usage. The results show that UnlinkableDFL converges reliably and adapts to node churn. Communication latency emerges as the main overhead, while memory and CPU usage stay moderate. These findings illustrate the balance between anonymity and system efficiency, demonstrating that strong unlinkability can be maintained in decentralized learning workflows."}

This property, termed perfect c-nonlinearity (PcN), represents optimal resistance to c-differential attacks - a concern highlighted by recent cryptanalysis of the Kuznyechik cipher variant. We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties. These results position perfect c-nonlinearity as a structurally distinct regime within permutation polynomial theory."}

To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms."}

The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites."}

Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments."}

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines."}

In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).\n  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs."}

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering."}

Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs.

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems."}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems."}

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation."}

However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training."}

Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains."}

Bo", "Lillio Mok", "Ashton Anderson"], "title": "Language Models Exhibit Inconsistent Biases Towards Algorithmic Agents and Human Experts", "comment": "Second Conference of the International Association for Safe and Ethical Artificial Intelligence (IASEAI 2026)", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety."}

Submitted to 17th World Symposium on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) on 01/14/2026", "summary": "Plans often change due to changes in the situation or our understanding of the situation. Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains."}
