We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries.

This\npaper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless\nnetwork to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to\nneutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method\nto estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our\nanalysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the\nperformance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the\nperfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas\nand simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ\nunder strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ\nmethod exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming\nespecially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of\njamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle\nmultiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF).

Efforts to detect and\nmitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while\ndata-plane signals remain largely overlooked.

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of\nthe TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the\ntrend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are\nexistent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three\nmodified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with\ncorresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability. Finally,\nthe accuracy and effectiveness of the TDS algorithm are further verified\nthrough numerical simulations and image processing cases."}

We adapt cognitive science methodologies from\nhuman mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using\nTikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical\nadvantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly\nabove chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth\nMA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by\nprobing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models\nevaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with\nrandomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may\nlack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We\nconclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate\nthe world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems."}

In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails.

This endeavor is fueled\nby smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things,\nextended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering\nindustrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To\nensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all\nthe aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize\nXR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their\nhead movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication\nnetworks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's\nhead movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in\nadvance. We validate that XR frame size varies in accordance with the human's\nhead movements and predict the corresponding bandwidth requirements from the\nmachine's camera to propose a human-machine coordinated dynamic bandwidth\nallocation (HMC-DBA) scheme. Through extensive simulations, we show that\nend-to-end latency and jitter requirements of XR frames are satisfied with much\nlower bandwidth consumption over enterprise networks like\nFiber-To-The-Room-Business. Furthermore, we show that better efficiency in\nnetwork resource utilization is achieved by employing our proposed HMC-DBA over\nstate-of-the-art schemes."}
