This goal is achieved in\nfully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).\nUnfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of\nthe entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output\nsignals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a\nlow-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from\nparticular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two\napproaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two\napproaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by\ncycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the\nentire space.

Federated Learning (FL) helps address some of\nthese concerns by decentralizing DL training to edge devices, thus reducing\ndata transmission costs and enhancing privacy. Yet, the computational demands\nof DL training can still interfere with SDN's performance, especially under the\ncontinuous data streams characteristic of IoT systems. To mitigate this issue,\nwe propose REDUS (Resampling for Efficient Data Utilization in Smart-Networks),\na resampling technique that optimizes DL training by prioritizing misclassified\nsamples and excluding redundant data, inspired by AdaBoost. REDUS reduces the\nnumber of training samples per epoch, thereby conserving computational\nresources, reducing energy consumption, and accelerating convergence without\nsignificantly impacting accuracy. Applied within an FL setup, REDUS enhances\nthe efficiency of model training on resource-limited edge devices while\nmaintaining network performance. In this paper, REDUS is evaluated on the\nCICIoT2023 dataset for IoT attack detection, showing a training time reduction\nof up to 72.6% with a minimal accuracy loss of only 1.62%, offering a scalable\nand practical solution for intelligent networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faREDUS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u5347SDN\u4e0eDL\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SDN\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0eDL\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREDUS\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAdaBoost\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u6392\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cREDUS\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1172.6%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.62%\u3002", "conclusion": "REDUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address such black-box network\nmanagement tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which\nleverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as\na promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts\ndescribing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated\nby LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions\nautonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective\nfunctions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has\nbeen studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to\nnumerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for the LLMO framework.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately.

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift.

We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of\nDynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for\ndynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MIMIC-Patient\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6784\u5efaMIMIC-Patient\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faDynamiCare\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DynamiCare\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamiCare\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks.

However, prevailing\nmethods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic\nAI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and\nmethodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual\ncontext but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be\ninefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm\nfocused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed\nin natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol\n(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles.

Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems.

The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "StepHint\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bRLVR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd1\u5931\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u5931\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "StepHint\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "StepHint\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "StepHint\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
