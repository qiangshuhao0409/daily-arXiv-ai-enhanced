We introduce both\nuniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word\nQuantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network\nQuantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses\nintroduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we\nintroduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the\nmemory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters\ncharacterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a\nsaving of 45\\% and 44\\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and\nits combination with the compression determines a 63.4\\% reduction in memory\nfootprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional\nreceiver."}

Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks.

Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative\nuncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality\nfollowing, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into\nhow MLLMs resolve conflicting information."}

Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature."}

Yet, this new language lacks\nsemantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With\nthe purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the\nworld, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of\ntranslating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we\nargue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a\nneurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the\nneural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic\nAI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are\nsatisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction\napproaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a\nframework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural\nnetworks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various\nexisting approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how\nlogical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we\nreview some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for\nneural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our\nframework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic\nencoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind."}

Under Review", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available. %We release an open-source implementation to support\ncontinued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning."}

This poses significant challenges in their deployment\non hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two\noptimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both\nuniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word\nQuantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network\nQuantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses\nintroduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we\nintroduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the\nmemory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters\ncharacterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a\nsaving of 45\\% and 44\\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and\nits combination with the compression determines a 63.4\\% reduction in memory\nfootprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional\nreceiver."}

Each hop transmission\nadaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including\nnumerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable\npacket transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the\nhop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and\npropose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware\ntransmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies\nin a distributed manner.
