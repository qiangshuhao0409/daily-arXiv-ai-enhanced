Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use\nthe local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while\noptimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the\ntrajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different\nfrom current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV,\nand an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical\nstate-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy\nand the target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the\nproposed AR-MARL scheme can reduce the average positioning error by up to 17.5%\nand 58.5% compared to the VD-MARL scheme and the proposed method without FAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08FAS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807UAV\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08AR-MARL\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RNN\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40Q\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAR-MARL\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4VD-MARL\u548c\u65e0FAS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e17.5%\u548c58.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "AR-MARL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807UAV\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics.

SIMs benefit from\nflexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for\ncostly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM\ndesigns face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy\nattenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose\nincorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of\nlayers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a\nmeta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal\nprocessing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains\nthe operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization\nproblem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and\nthe desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of\nthe meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a\nnon-interference system with parallel subchannels is established.

Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our\nframework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational\ncomplexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in\nXL-MIMO systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea7\u8054\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7b49\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8d85\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800cXL-MIMO\u548cRIS\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7684CSI\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5728XL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u53d7XL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5929\u7ebf\u548cRIS\u5143\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

We show that the\njoint design of transmission scheduling and estimation can be reduced to a\nsequential optimization of estimation and scheduling. The scheduling problem\ncan be formulated as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) , for which it is\ndifficult to establish indexability. We propose a low-complexity Maximum Gain\nFirst (MGF) policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal as the numbers of\nsources and channels scale up proportionally, without requiring the\nindexability condition. We also provide an information-theoretic interpretation\nof the transmission scheduling problem. Numerical results show that our\nestimation and scheduling policies achieves higher performance gain over\nperiodic updating, randomized policy, and Maximum Age First (MAF) policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u591a\u901a\u9053\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f20\u8f93\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684MGF\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u65b0\u9c9c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c06\u5371\u9669\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u6781\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMGF\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7d22\u5f15\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMGF\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u548cMAF\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "MGF\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u591a\u901a\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We define two equilibrium concepts:\nreasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal\nprompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning\nequilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized\nmodels over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded\nrationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation.

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams.

To address\nthis, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for\nsystematically evaluating verifiers.

We design a four-dimensional experimental\nframework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized\nverifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.\ncomplete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers\nfundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve\nleading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show\nstronger inclusivity but unstable precision.

The HAPPO\nalgorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update\nscheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).\nHowever, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing\n(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$\nwith the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived\nfrom Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating\nthe conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential\npolicy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)\nas the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to\noptimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for\nOMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a\nCentralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously\nachieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function\ncomputation.

Based\non this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of\neach reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically\nselecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and\nSelf-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and\ncommonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in\nboth unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on\nlarge reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning\nmodels. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction\nability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement\npath for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6821\u51c6CoT\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5728LLMs\u548cMLLMs\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53cd\u6620\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aCoT\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for\nprompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based\nimprovements to human decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u201c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u9519\u7684\u5417\uff1f\u201d\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eLLMs\u4ecd\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u901a\u7528\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u501f\u9274\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u201c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u9519\u7684\u5417\uff1f\u201d\uff09\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u53cd\u601d\u5176\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset.

However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene\ngeneration, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a\nhandful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We\nthen extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel\nscenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed\nscenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a\npre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,\naddressing critical challenges in computational immunology", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u514d\u75ab\u5b66\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MAML\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
