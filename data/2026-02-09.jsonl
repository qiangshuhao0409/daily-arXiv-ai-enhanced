This system operates in what is referred to as a dense reader environment, where readers are placed close to each other to optimize coverage. However, this setup comes with its challenges, as it increases the likelihood of collisions between readers and tags (reader-to-reader and reader-to-tag), leading to reduced network performance. To address this issue, various protocols have been proposed, with centralized solutions emerging as promising options due to their ability to deliver higher throughput. In this paper, we propose the Intelligence and Efficient Reader Anti-collision Protocol (IE-RAP) that improves network performance such as throughput, average waiting time, and energy consumption, which employs a powerful combination of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) mechanisms. IE-RAP improves the efficiency of RFID networks through techniques such as the SIFT function and distance calculation between readers. By preventing re-read tags and ensuring the on-time release of the communication channel, we effectively eliminate unnecessary collisions. Our simulations emphasize the superiority of our proposed method, it increases 26% throughput, reduces 74% the average waiting time, and lower by 52% the energy consumption compared to existing approaches. Importantly, our solution supports the seamless integration of mobile readers within the network."}

The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments."}

Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64.

Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area."}

This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability. These findings highlight the potential of deep unfolding combined with uncertainty-aware training as a powerful approach for robust optimization in 6G networks."}

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals."}

A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is also presented, revealing the system's fundamental diversity order. Building on this analysis, we formulate a novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that, unlike idealized models, uniquely incorporates the non-trivial time and energy overheads of FAS port selection. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize key system parameters. Numerical results validate our analysis, demonstrating that while FAS provides substantial power gains, the operational overhead creates a critical trade-off. This trade-off dictates an optimal number of FAS ports and a non-trivial optimal UAV deployment altitude, governed by the balance between blockage and path loss. This work provides key insights for FAS-aided UAV communications."}

They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench."}

Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws."}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding."}

However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling.

It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations."}

One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems."}

The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial."}

We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability.

Furthermore, to support robust aggregation of clients' updates over wireless channels, we integrate this client self-selection strategy into the recently proposed type-based unsourced multiple-access framework over distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) networks.

Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims.

However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems."}

Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results.

Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent."}

In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL.

We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property.

SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability."}

We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers."}

ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency.

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules.

POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding.

In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework"}

To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research."}

We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration."}
