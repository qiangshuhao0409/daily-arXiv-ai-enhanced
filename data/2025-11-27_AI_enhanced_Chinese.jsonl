This doubles the theoretical throughput compared to rank 2 MIMO and also improves reception performance. However, 4x4 MIMO support on low-band frequencies (<1 GHz) is absent in every commercial UEs, with the exception of the Xperia 1 flagship smartphones manufactured by Sony Mobile and the Xiaomi 14 Pro as of January 2024. The reason most manufacturers omit 4x4 MIMO support for low-band frequencies is likely due to design challenges or relatively small performance gains in real-world usage due to the lack of 4T4R deployment on low-band by mobile network operators around the world.\n  In Thailand, 4T4R deployment on the b28/n28 (APT) band is common on True-H and dtac networks, enabling 4x4 MIMO transmission on supported UEs. In this paper, the real-world 4x4 MIMO performance on the b28/n28 (APT) band will be investigated by evaluating the reliability test under different signal conditions and the maximum throughput test by evaluating the performance under optimal conditions, using the Sony Xperia 1 III and the Sony Xperia 1 IV smartphone. Devices from other manufacturers are also used in the experiment to investigate the performance with 2Rx antennas for comparison. Through firmware modifications, the Sony Xperia 1 III and IV can be configured to use only 2 Rx ports on low-band, enabling the collection of comparative 2 Rx performance data as a reference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7d22\u5c3cXperia 1 III\u548cIV\u624b\u673a\u5728\u6cf0\u56fdb28/n28\u9891\u6bb5\u4e0a\u76844x4 MIMO\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4ec5\u652f\u63012Rx\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5546\u75285G\u624b\u673a\u90fd\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\uff08<1 GHz\uff09\u76844x4 MIMO\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7d22\u5c3cXperia 1\u65d7\u8230\u7cfb\u5217\u548c\u5c0f\u7c7314 Pro\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u6cf0\u56fdTrue-H\u548cdtac\u7f51\u7edc\u5728b28/n28\u9891\u6bb5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e864T4R\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a764x4 MIMO\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7d22\u5c3cXperia 1 III\u548cIV\u624b\u673a\u5728\u6cf0\u56fdb28/n28\u9891\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b2\uff09\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\u4f7f\u8bbe\u5907\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282\u4e2aRx\u7aef\u53e3\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u5382\u5546\u8bbe\u5907\u4f5c\u4e3a2Rx\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u5c55\u793a4x4 MIMO\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u6700\u5927\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e2Rx\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u63ed\u793a4x4 MIMO\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u5236\u9020\u5546\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u6bb5\u90e8\u7f724T4R\u548c\u624b\u673a\u652f\u63014x4 MIMO\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.\n  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e865G SA\u30015G NSA\u548cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f4\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b05G SA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c5G NSA\u548cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77405G SA\u5728\u6cf0\u56fd\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f4\u64ad\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e5G NSA\u548cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7MPEG-DASH\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f4\u64ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e22\u5305\u7387\u3001MAC\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9759\u6b62\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "5G SA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c5G NSA\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cLTE\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u8d85\u8fc720%\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6309\u65f6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u3002", "conclusion": "5G SA\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8d85\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c5G NSA\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7406\u7531\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\u7b49\u6700\u4f18\u5d4c\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6839\u636e\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u572816\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7LLM\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u534f\u52a9\u3002"}}

First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.", "AI": {"tldr": "AssurAI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u97e9\u8bed\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210AI\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11,480\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8986\u76d635\u79cdAI\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u97e9\u8bed\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\uff08\u5982\u97e9\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8635\u79cdAI\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u64ad\u79cd\u548c\u4f17\u5305\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u91cd\u72ec\u7acb\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea2\u961f\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AssurAI\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u65b0LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AssurAI\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e3a\u97e9\u56fd\u793e\u533a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations.

This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528beam\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u9650\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i)\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(ii)\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u4f55\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(iii)\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6700\u5e38\u7528\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\uff0c10-40%\u901a\u8fc7beam\u641c\u7d22\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684beam\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits.

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prune4Web\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684Web\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DOM\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684LLM\u8bfb\u53d6\u8f6c\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u9875\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2dDOM\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-based Web\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b10,000-100,000\u4e2atoken\u7684\u5927\u578bDOM\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684DOM\u622a\u65ad\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5355\u72ec\u6392\u540d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDOM\u6811\u526a\u679d\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Python\u8bc4\u5206\u811a\u672c\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u89e3\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4DOM\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u578bDOM\uff0c\u5c06\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5019\u9009\u5143\u7d2025\u500d\u523050\u500d\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece46.8%\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u523088.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "Prune4Web\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Web\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684DOM\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cWeb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions.

This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated.

This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts.

This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state.

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.
