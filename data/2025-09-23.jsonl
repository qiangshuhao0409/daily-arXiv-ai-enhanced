The\ncombination with an outer non-binary low density parity check (NB-LDPC) code\nwas recently shown to improve the finite-length performance of these codes over\nthe unfaded AWGN channel. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\napproximate message passing (AMP) decoder that is capable of decoding NB-LDPC\nencoded SPARCs on a Rayleigh fading channel with multiple receive antennas.\nNotably, the decoder does not require channel state information (CSI), i.e., it\nis fully non-coherent, but achieves the same error probability as a decoder\nwith full CSI, even for moderate block lengths. This is achieved by iteratively\nre-estimating the channel throughout the decoding iterations. In addition, we\nprovide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of both the block error probability and\nthe channel estimation error. Numerical results confirm the precision of the\nanalysis and show that the presented coding scheme performs within 1.5 dB of\nthe outage capacity and is competitive with coded modulation schemes employing\nstandardised LDPC codes for 5G cellular networks and pilot-based channel\nestimation."}

Orthogonal time\nfrequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a resilient\nalternative, as its delay-Doppler domain representation enables robust\ncommunication and high-resolution sensing. Motivated by this, we extend OTFS to\ndistributed ISAC and address the underexplored problem of spatial node\ndeployment. We propose a triangulation-based framework that leverages spatial\ndiversity to improve target localization, velocity estimation, and\ncommunication rates, and analytically characterize the role of deployment\ngeometry in minimizing estimation error.

One of the most\ncommon tools used to check if everything is working properly is called\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking\nwhether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only\nreact after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This\nmakes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model\nwas able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of\nfuture measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers\nand technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps\nreduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability\nof the production process.

LIMI (Less Is\nMore for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically\ndifferent development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative\nsoftware development and scientific research workflows, we show that\nsophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically\ncurated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed\ntraining samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks,\ndramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%),\nDeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%).\nMost strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on\n10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer\nsamples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine\nautonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of\nhigh-quality agentic demonstrations."}

A central challenge of this task\nlies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply\nnested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where\nexisting methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis,\nidentifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current\nevaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced\nmultimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is\nfine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve\ngeneration quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy\nbased on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches\nthat optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a\nstructure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from\nrendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality.

Recent work\nshowed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive\nequivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such\nredundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the\nRashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs,\ni.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work,\nMcTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related\nwith DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach,\nwhich this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method\nof Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal\nform) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for\npredictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was\nalso applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to\nfinding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of\nformula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy,\nand the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space.\nThis paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the\nworst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the\npaper shows that the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the\nproblem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of\nthe problems to which the minimum-size DNF representation has been applied to\ncan in fact be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT.

This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation.
