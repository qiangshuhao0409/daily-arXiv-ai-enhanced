Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."}

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to\nalign semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative\nelements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Specifically, we propose a thinking\nprotocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges\nintermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the\nthinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through\nreinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%\nlower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy\non mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned\nasynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without\nadditional training."}

We\nintroduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization\nservers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and\nissue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the\nagents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on\ndelegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically\nappropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce\nASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic\nmatching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and\ncurrent limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of\nscopes needed for task completion increases.

Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding\nintra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal\nthat text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key\nspace rather than solely from external data factors."}

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment."}

Using causal mediation analysis on\na diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of\nattention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of\nthe filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate\nthat this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted\nand reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,\npresented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also\nidentify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for\nfiltering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing\nthis intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our\nresults reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable\nimplementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways\nthat are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional\nprogramming patterns."}
