### [1] [Rethinking Reliability Using Network Coding: a Practical 5G Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10247)
*Laura Landon,Vipindev Adat Vasudevan,Junmo Sung,Muriel Médard*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文设计并实现了一个集成到5G测试床IP层的实时网络编码系统，替代传统的基于重传的可靠性机制（如ARQ和HARQ），通过随机线性网络编码（RLNC）提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于重传的可靠性机制（如ARQ和HARQ）在无线系统中效率较低，尤其是在高丢包率环境下。网络编码（如RLNC）提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用基于netfilter的数据包拦截框架，在5G测试床的gNB和UE之间的实时流量中注入RLNC，并评估块编码方案对吞吐量、抖动和资源使用的影响。

Result: 实验表明，通过选择合适的编码率，RLNC能以比ARQ/HARQ更少的传输次数完全恢复丢包，并在中高丢包率下保持高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 网络编码（如RLNC）可以高效替代基于重传的可靠性机制，未来无线系统有望通过其实现更高效的资源利用。

Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a real-time network
coding system integrated into the IP layer of a 5G testbed, offering an
alternative to conventional retransmission-based reliability mechanisms such as
ARQ and HARQ. Using a netfilter-based packet interception framework, we inject
forward erasure correction using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) into live
traffic between a gNB and UE over a 3GPP RF link. We evaluate a block coding
scheme, analyzing its impact on throughput, jitter, and resource usage. Results
show that with appropriate code rate selection, RLNC can fully recover from
packet losses using fewer transmissions than ARQ/HARQ and maintain a high
throughput, particularly under moderate-to-high packet loss rates. These
findings demonstrate that network coding can effectively replace
retransmission-based reliability in future wireless systems, with the potential
for more efficient resource utilization.

### [2] [Design of a Timer Queue Supporting Dynamic Update Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10283)
*Zekun Wang,Binghao Yue,Weitao Pan,Jiangyi Shi,Yue Hao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉动阵列和移位寄存器的混合架构硬件优先级队列，用于高效管理大规模计时器队列，解决了传统实现中计时精度低和计算开销高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模计时器在网络处理中普遍存在，但传统实现存在计时精度低和计算开销高的局限性。

Method: 设计了一种混合架构硬件优先级队列，支持五种操作（入队、出队、删除、更新和查看），并首次实现了队列内优先级更新。

Result: 实验结果显示，该设计在FPGA上运行频率超过400 MHz，资源消耗比现有最优实现减少2.2-2.8倍。

Conclusion: 该设计显著提高了计时器队列管理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large-scale timers are ubiquitous in network processing, including flow table
entry expiration control in software defined network (SDN) switches, MAC
address aging in Ethernet bridges, and retransmission timeout management in
TCP/IP protocols. Conventional implementations suffer from critical
limitations: low timing accuracy due to large-scale timer traversal and high
computational overhead for new timer insertion. This paper presents a
hybrid-architecture hardware priority queue based on systolic arrays and shift
registers for efficient timer queue management. The design uniquely supports
five operations: enqueue, dequeue, delete, update, and peek.To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first hardware priority queue enabling in-queue priority
updates. By leveraging centralized Boolean logic encoding within systolic
blocks, the design efficiently generates set/shift control signals while the
novel push-first operation ensures FIFO ordering for same-priority timers
without additional metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the design
operates at over 400 MHz on FPGAs, achieving a 2.2-2.8x reduction in resource
consumption compared to state-of-the-art implementations.

### [3] [Near-realtime Earth Observation Via Starlink LEO Satellite Constellation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10338)
*Bo Wu,Pengfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用Starlink卫星基础设施支持地球观测卫星数据传输的可行性，提出了一种名为“Starlink Space User”（SSU）的新系统，通过优化链路和PoP选择以及调度算法，显著减少了数据积压。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星数据传输面临地面站数量有限和通信窗口短暂的挑战，而Starlink卫星星座提供了连续连接的可能性。

Method: 提出SSU系统，将观测卫星视为Starlink的空间用户，并设计链路选择、PoP选择和调度优化算法。

Result: 通过仿真和实际测量，证明SSU设计能显著减少卫星数据积压的中位数。

Conclusion: SSU系统利用Starlink基础设施，为地球观测卫星数据传输提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are collecting
vast amounts of data, which are invaluable for applications such as monitoring
forest fires. However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant
challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief
communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like
Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for
ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink
satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated
as "Starlink Space User" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites.
SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient
data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms
designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization,
that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure. We assess
the performance of SSU using trace-driven simulations alongside real-world
Starlink performance measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
Starlink-aided design can significantly reduce the median backlog (data not
delivered) per satellite.

### [4] [Probabilistic Latency Analysis of the Data Distribution Service in ROS 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10413)
*Sanghoon Lee,Hyung-Seok Park,Jiyeong Chae,Kyung-Joon Park*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种概率延迟分析（PLA）方法，用于建模ROS 2 DDS通信的可靠传输过程，解决了无线网络中参数调优的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2 DDS在无线网络中的可靠性传输参数调优缺乏理论指导，导致端到端延迟行为不明确。

Method: 采用离散状态方法，系统分析中间件和传输层事件，计算未确认消息的稳态概率分布和重传延迟。

Result: 通过270种场景验证，PLA的预测与实验结果高度吻合。

Conclusion: PLA为无线工业机器人中可靠性、延迟和性能的系统优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

### [5] [Federated Learning Over LoRa Networks: Simulator Design and Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10574)
*Anshika Singh,Siddhartha S. Borkotoky*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文开发了一个基于Python的模拟器，用于评估在LoRa网络上的联邦学习性能，重点研究了FEC对FL收敛和设备通信时间的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在LoRa网络上实现联邦学习的挑战，如带宽限制、干扰和严格的占空比约束。

Method: 集成并扩展了Flower和LoRaSim框架，开发了一个详细的链路级模型，支持多种优化技术（如稀疏化、量化、压缩、FEC等）。

Result: 数值结果表明FEC在LoRa网络上对FL性能的关键作用，并分析了传输参数和干扰的影响。

Conclusion: FEC对FL在LoRa网络上的实现至关重要，为通信协议设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over long-range (LoRa) low-power wide area networks
faces unique challenges due to limited bandwidth, interference, and strict
duty-cycle constraints. We develop a Python-based simulator that integrates and
extends the Flower and LoRaSim frameworks to evaluate centralized FL over LoRa
networks. The simulator employs a detailed link-level model for FL update
transfer over LoRa channels, capturing LoRa's receiver sensitivity,
interference characteristics, block-fading effects, and constraints on the
maximum transmission unit. It supports update sparsification, quantization,
compression, forward frame-erasure correction (FEC), and duty cycling.
Numerical results illustrate the impact of transmission parameters (spreading
factor, FEC rate) and interference on FL performance. Demonstrating the
critical role of FEC in enabling FL over LoRa networks, we perform an in-depth
evaluation of the impact of FEC on FL convergence and device airtime, providing
insights for communication protocol design for FL over LoRa networks.

### [6] [Balancing the Energy Consumption and Latency of Over-the-Air Firmware Updates in LoRaWAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10588)
*Siddhartha S. Borkotoky*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活的LoRaWAN固件更新方案，通过调整扩频因子实现能耗与延迟的可调权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRaWAN终端设备在能源受限和传输限制下，固件更新的能耗与延迟问题。

Method: 采用顺序使用LoRa扩频因子的方式传输更新帧，通过调整最小扩频因子和每因子的传输次数实现能耗与延迟的权衡。

Result: 方案可根据需求选择低延迟高能耗或高延迟低能耗的更新策略。

Conclusion: 该方案为LoRaWAN固件更新提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-the-air firmware updates are crucial for mitigating security threats and
maintaining up-to-date device functionality in Long Range Wide Area Networks
(LoRaWANs). LoRaWAN end devices are usually energy-constrained, and LoRaWAN
transmissions are subject to duty-cycle restrictions. Consequently, controlling
the energy expenditure and update-delivery latency of FUOTA are key challenges.
We propose a flexible scheme that achieves a tunable trade-off between the
energy consumption and delivery delay. The scheme employs the LoRa spreading
factors sequentially to transmit update-carrying frames, sending a fixed number
of frames with a given spreading factor before moving to the next. By adjusting
the smallest spreading factor to be used and the number of transmissions per
spreading factor, a suitable energy-delay trade-off can be achieved. Thus,
time-sensitive updates, such as security patches, may be sent with a
low-delay-high-energy setting, whereas a more energy-efficient but higher-delay
setting may be used for non-critical updates.

portal that integrates resources of cleaned datasets, code and paper repository
to benefit the community. Finally, we identify limitations in current
methodologies and outline future research opportunities.

teams developed state-of-the-art techniques, introducing novel approaches in
reasoning-based safety alignment, robust model guardrails, multi-turn
jail-breaking, and efficient probing of large language models (LLMs). To
support these efforts, the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team made substantial
scientific and engineering investments, including building a custom baseline
coding specialist model for the challenge from scratch, developing a tournament
orchestration service, and creating an evaluation harness. This paper outlines
the advancements made by university teams and the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team
in addressing the safety challenges of AI for software development,
highlighting this collaborative effort to raise the bar for AI safety.

Conclusion: 模块化架构使系统易于扩展，同时保留决策过程细节，加权聚合方法优于算法阈值优化。

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了开源深度研究代理（ODR）与闭源系统的性能对比，通过改进ODR提出了ODR+模型，在BC-Small基准上达到了10%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理（DRAs）多为闭源系统，缺乏开源选项，研究旨在填补这一空白并提升性能。

Method: 通过调整BrowseComp基准为BC-Small，比较ODR与闭源系统性能，并对ODR进行三项改进得到ODR+。

Result: ODR+在BC-Small测试集上达到10%的成功率，优于其他系统。

Conclusion: 开源系统ODR+通过改进在性能上可与闭源系统竞争，为学术研究提供了可行工具。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长推理链增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，需要平衡推理效果与效率。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准上将平均输出长度减少50%以上，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下高效引导大型推理模型的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI是一个新型AutoML框架，通过动态解决方案空间探索和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，解决了现有LLM-based AutoML系统的探索局限和执行瓶颈问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略受限和执行瓶颈问题，如缺乏多样性和无法重组强部分解，以及冗长的代码验证周期。

Method: KompeteAI引入动态解决方案空间探索，包括合并阶段组合候选方案，并结合RAG技术从Kaggle和arXiv中获取策略。此外，通过预测评分模型和加速调试方法减少执行时间。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中平均优于现有方法3%，并将管道评估速度提升6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法解决了AutoML系统的关键问题，并在性能上实现了显著提升。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Conclusion: 事件熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础强、可解释且多功能的方法。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our
training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HATRPO中固定KL阈值导致更新缓慢和局部最优，尤其在异构环境中。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化全局KL约束）和HATRPO-G（贪心算法按改进-散度比分配阈值）。

Result: 实验显示两种方法均显著提升HATRPO性能，最终奖励提高超22.5%，HATRPO-W稳定性更优。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配策略有效提升异构多智能体强化学习的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的想象推理能力提供了新见解，并为未来探索性代理行为研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Method: LeanRAG通过语义聚合算法构建实体集群和显式关系，并采用自底向上的结构引导检索策略。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，LeanRAG显著优于现有方法，同时减少46%的检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过优化知识聚合和检索策略，提升了RAG的效果和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异，对未见医学代码保持高准确性。

Conclusion: HiRef通过结合本体知识和优化共现模式，显著提升了药物推荐的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过系统化设计和强化学习，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术知识图谱（SKG）问答中，LLM生成的SPARQL查询存在结构和语义错误，需改进。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和查询修正层，评估多种配置（零样本、单样本、微调等）。

Result: 微调方法表现最佳，ROUGE-L达0.90，RelaxedEM达0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架有效提升SKG问答中SPARQL查询的准确性和结果质量。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Motivation: 当前的空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在执行复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时用户体验受限。

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLMs的语言能力实现交互式操作（如澄清查询细节和动态调整搜索），并提出一种定制的LLM适配流程，通过对话合成和多模型协作将自然语言与结构化空间数据对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT为扩展空间搜索提供了端到端的解决方案，适用于真实数据和实际应用场景。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT通过LLMs增强了空间查询的灵活性和交互性，为复杂空间搜索任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

Motivation: 现有AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法主导全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生负担和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B模型，赋予其深度思考能力，使其能够主导诊断流程，并建立责任框架。

Result: 在罕见、复杂和真实案例中，DxDirector-7B显著优于现有医学和通用LLM，减少医生工作量并提高准确性。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转向主导诊断的新时代，为高效精准诊断提供解决方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和计算效率低的问题，限制了其在医疗任务中的应用。

Method: PASS通过自适应采样代理工作流、概率标注路径、动态工具选择和个性化记忆压缩，结合三阶段训练优化性能与成本。

Result: PASS在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型，平衡了计算成本，提升了准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗AI系统提供了一种可解释、自适应和多模态的新范式。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Result: 实验表明，动态数据在某些模型上效果显著（如Llama-3），而在其他模型上效果较差（如Zephyr）。

Conclusion: 对齐阶段假设为优化语言模型对齐提供了理论支持，并提出了一种有效的边界测量方法。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Conclusion: ComMCS通过减少方差有效提升了大型语言模型的数学推理能力，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多种下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性控制提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP是一种基于预训练语言模型的对话推荐系统，通过课程引导的上下文-知识融合和轻量级任务特定提示调优，解决了现有系统在捕捉用户偏好和对话上下文深层语义方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统难以有效整合外部知识图谱信息，导致推荐结果与用户期望不符。

Method: STEP采用三阶段课程逐步对齐对话上下文与知识图谱实体，并通过双重提示（对话前缀和推荐前缀）将融合表示注入冻结的语言模型。

Result: STEP在两个公共数据集上的推荐精度和对话质量优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过上下文-知识融合和双重提示调优，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Method: 提出AgenticDRS系统，利用图匹配和提示扩展方法，通过多智能体协作分析设计。

Result: 实验表明AgenticDRS在评估图形设计和生成反馈方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: AgenticDRS为图形设计评审提供了有效解决方案，并呼吁关注这一研究方向。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示方法，解决了大规模规划问题中密集图表示导致的组合爆炸和信息稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用全连接图表示规划状态，导致边缘信息组合爆炸和节点信息稀释，难以扩展到大规模问题。

Method: 提出稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示，选择性编码局部关系并显式整合目标相关空间特征。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在更大网格规模上的有效性，显著提高了策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 为大规模通用规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，其带来的错误信息风险增加。现有研究多关注内容真实性，而较少探讨其对人类行为和感知的影响。

Method: 引入MhAIM数据集（含154,552篇在线帖子，其中111,153篇为AI生成），提出信任度、影响力和开放性三个新指标，并开发了基于LLM的T-Lens系统，其核心是HR-MCP协议。

Result: 研究发现，当帖子包含文本和视觉内容时，人类更易识别AI生成内容（尤其是两者不一致时）。T-Lens系统能更好地预测和响应用户行为。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM提供了人类感知能力的实证工具，揭示了AI、人类认知和信息接收的复杂关系，提出了减少AI错误信息风险的实际策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [36] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过临床试验自然语言推理基准测试发现，尽管大型语言模型在知识获取上表现优异，但在结构化推理任务中表现不佳，揭示了其内部表征的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否通过简单扩展数据和参数就能获得结构化、可泛化的内部表征。

Method: 引入包含四种推理类型的临床试验自然语言推理基准测试，并使用GKMRV探针分离知识获取和推理失败。

Result: 模型在知识获取上表现优异（准确率0.918），但在推理任务中表现差（准确率0.25），输出一致性高（0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型缺乏结构化内部表征，无法可靠部署知识，GKMRV框架为高风险领域提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了可解释AI（XAI）在视觉障碍用户中的可访问性问题，通过文献综述和概念验证提出包容性设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在关键决策中的广泛应用，可解释性成为提升用户理解和选择的关键，但视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足。

Method: 采用文献综述（79项研究）和四部分概念验证（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）分析XAI的可访问性。

Result: 初步发现简化解释对非视觉用户更易理解，多模态呈现能提升公平可解释性。

Conclusion: XAI设计需考虑视觉障碍用户，简化解释和多模态呈现是提升可访问性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

### [38] [Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了新的斜多环码的等价和等距定义，减少了已知的分类数量，并明确了不同概念的重合条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确地分类斜多环码，减少重复代码，并扩展非结合代数环境下的应用。

Method: 利用斜多环码生成器与主左理想生成器的一一对应关系，通过代数同构保持汉明距离来分类代码。

Result: 减少了等价和等距分类的数量，明确了重合条件，并扩展了非结合代数环境下的代码分类。

Conclusion: 新定义提供了更紧的分类方法，适用于非结合代数环境，并可用于秩度量线性码的分类。

Abstract: We propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic
codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This helps
to reduce the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes, and
state precisely when these different notions coincide. In the process, we
classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same
performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes.
  We exploit that the generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one
correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient
algebra. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called
isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal
left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes.
We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need
on restrictions on the length of the codes. The isometries between the ambient
algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with
the rank metric.

Motivation: RIS技术是6G系统的关键技术，但CSI获取困难。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于酉群码的DSTM方案，并与DRM结合，扩展了反射模式数量，提供了编码和解码的复杂度分析。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DRM-DSTM编码系统在准静态瑞利衰落信道中优于未编码DRM。

Conclusion: DRM-DSTM方案有效解决了RIS系统中的CSI获取问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) hold the promise of improving
significantly coverage, as well as spectral and energy efficiency in wireless
communication systems. Techniques based on RIS form a key technology for 6G
systems. An important issue in RIS technology is Channel State Information
(CSI), which is much more difficult to acquire in such systems. This work
introduces a Differential Space-Time Modulation (DSTM) scheme integrated with
Differential Reflecting Modulation (DRM) to bypass the requirement for CSI in
such systems, while providing error rate gains. The DSTM scheme is based on
unitary group codes. We first consider uncoded DRM for RIS to serve as a
reference point. Next we provide an overview of DSTM and outline the procedures
for its integration with DRM. Furthermore, we explore the extension of both the
original DRM and the coded DRM-DSTM scheme to a larger number of RIS reflecting
patterns $K$, and provide tables of codes for $K= 2, 3, 4$. Encoding and
decoding complexities are studied as well. Extensives simulation results over
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels confirm the effectiveness of the DRM-DSTM
coded system, illustrating its advantages over uncoded DRM with proper system
parameters.

Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem.
This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the
minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the
average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor.
As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional
Sibson's mutual information.

Motivation: 物联网技术发展面临四大需求：超低功耗、高谱效、低成本和大规模连接，传统方法难以兼顾。

Method: 提出两种方案：IM-CPM-SS利用索引调制选择扩频序列；CIM-CPM-SS通过码索引调制将输入比特分为两部分映射。

Result: 两种方案在BER、谱效、能效及非线性失真下表现优于传统方法，并保持恒包络特性。

Conclusion: IM-CPM-SS和CIM-CPM-SS在NOMA系统中显著提升性能，适用于物联网场景。

Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key
demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced
implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate
continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We
begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.
The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select
spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency
while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred
to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the
input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the
other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in
terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational
complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear
amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes
outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of
constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher
spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear
distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission.
Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited
processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated
communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal
delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication
and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver
onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF)
front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol
compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel
estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing
framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve
high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and
interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed
integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive
simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR)
prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging
and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE)

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了MA部署中的速度不匹配问题，提升了实时链路优化和安全性。

Abstract: In complex urban environments, dynamic obstacles and multipath effects lead
to significant link attenuation and pervasive coverage blind spots.
Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV
trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time
adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has
emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and
reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude
communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch
between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining
real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we
propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal
antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a
Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA
positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories.
Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction
exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MapLibre Tile（MLT）格式，一种新型矢量瓦片规范，旨在解决Mapbox Vector Tile（MVT）格式的局限性。实验表明，MLT在压缩比和解码速度上显著优于MVT，并支持新功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVT格式已有十年历史，无法完全适应新兴地理空间数据源的需求，如数据量激增和人工智能自动化检测。

Method: 提出MLT格式，重新设计矢量瓦片规范，并通过实验模拟用户会话，对比MVT的性能。

Result: MLT在压缩比上比MVT高3倍，某些大瓦片上甚至超过6倍；解码速度快3倍，处理性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MLT为下一代地图渲染器奠定了基础，支持GPU处理，克服摩尔定律停滞问题。

Abstract: The Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format is widely considered the leading open
standard for large-scale map visualization, as evidenced by its widespread
adoption by major technology companies such as AWS, Meta, and Microsoft for
their products and services. However, MVT was developed nearly a decade ago
and, consequently, does not fully align with the capabilities of new geospatial
data sources that are characterized by rapidly increasing data volumes due to
advancements in geospatial sensors and automated detection through artificial
intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the MapLibre Tile (MLT) format, a
novel vector tile specification designed from the ground up to address the
limitations of MVT. Our experiments, simulating user sessions on widely used
basemap datasets, demonstrate that MLT achieves up to three times better
compression ratios compared to MVT on encoded tilesets, with over six times
better on certain large tiles. Additionally, MLT offers decoding speeds that
are up to three times faster and significantly enhances processing performance.
MLT also introduces new functionalities and is specifically designed to lay the
foundation for the next generation of map renderers, which we expect to
entirely offload processing to the GPU, thereby overcoming the stagnation of
Moore`s law.
