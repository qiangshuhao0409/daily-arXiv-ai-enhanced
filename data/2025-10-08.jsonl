The schedule is\ndesigned such that the scheduled traffic is forwarded by the TSN bridges with\nno or only little queuing delay. To protect that traffic against other frames,\nthe TAS is configured on all interfaces such that lower-priority queues can\nsend only when high-priority traffic is not supposed to be forwarded.

While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,\nAI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.\nDrawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to\ninvestigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings\nprovide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents\ncollaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants\nshift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and\ninterpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when\nsocial context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their\npersonal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over\ntime. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere\nagreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,\nsuggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design."}

Sequential\nscaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling\ninvolves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining\nthese two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4\nHeavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),\nverifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This\nproperty, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong\npotential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential\nand parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that\nverification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In\nexperiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget\nforcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging\nasymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial\nimprovements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We\nconduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their\n``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up\nto 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an\nopen-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\\bf 54.0\\%} on\nBrowseComp and {\\bf 66.0\\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best\nproprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research.

Given a task, the\ntypical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and\nthen (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.\nCrucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,\none that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.\nWe argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new\nperformance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven\nsolution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI."}

However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies."}
