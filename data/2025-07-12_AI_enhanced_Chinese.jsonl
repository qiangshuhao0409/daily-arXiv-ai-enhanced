High-performance localization and sensing\nsystems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent\napplications.

In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations.

In this context, the emergence of smart cities,\ncharacterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents\nsignificant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient\narchitecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network,\nwhose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication\nsystem to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video)\nbetween citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote\nmonitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the\nSDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled\nflooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and\ntested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of\nobstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average\nlatency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and\n726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow\nnetwork, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all\nfunctionalities associated with the HaLert architecture.

Biases,\noften arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,\ncompromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers\nare less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made\nstrides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the\ncritical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further\npropose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to\nassess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction.

This paper argues that, contrary\nto prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead\nto a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those\nwith limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the\nperformance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating\nthat under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability\nreturns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,\nwe argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies\nthat can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will\neventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we\ngive several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture\nimportant capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and\ntheoretical performance models.
