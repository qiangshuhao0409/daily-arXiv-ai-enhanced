We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly.

We\nformalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them\nas subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between\ngreedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in\nbenchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the\nperformance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of\ngreedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent.

Exploring New Paradigms in Assisting Classical Planners with Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central\nchallenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion\ncaused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the\neffectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful\nactions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely\noverlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid\nplans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with\nproblem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into\nmultiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize\nLLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where\nLLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and\nLLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.\nWe empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple\ndomains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving\nlarge-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM4Inspire\u548cLLM4Predict\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89c4\u5212\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5148\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7LLM4Inspire\uff08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548cLLM4Predict\uff08\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u65ad\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0cLLM4Predict\u56e0\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eLLM4Inspire\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\uff08\u5982LLM4Predict\uff09\u5728\u4fee\u526a\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
