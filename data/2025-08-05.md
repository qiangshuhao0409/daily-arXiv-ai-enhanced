### [1] [A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based TCP Congestion Control Algorithm: Design, Simulation, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01047)

### [2] [Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01898)
*Yijing Zhang,Md-Ferdous Pervej,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的两阶段视频缓存优化方法，结合联邦学习和多阶段背包问题，显著提升系统收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频缓存能提升无线视频流传输效率，但缓存策略需适应动态用户需求以最大化系统收益。

Method: 1. 使用隐私保护的联邦学习训练Transformer预测多时段需求；2. 结合全局内容流行度和预测结果优化缓存策略。

Result: 联邦学习方案性能接近理想集中式方案，且优于现有缓存方法；收益优化方法比传统缓存命中率方法更深入。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在隐私保护和系统收益优化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance
quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless
communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be
designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system
revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested
videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache
replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the
replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache
placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.
Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution
for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a
Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict
multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely
accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content
popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand
distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results
to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This
latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we
then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results
demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to
that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching
methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper
system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based
optimization approaches.

*Ibrahim Althamary,Chen-Fu Chou,Chih-Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAAC-SAM的多智能体强化学习框架，用于动态管理卫星-地面车辆网络中的连接，通过多注意力机制和自模仿学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中卫星-地面车辆网络的动态性和部分可观测性对连接管理提出了挑战，需要一种高效的自适应解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体Actor-Critic框架，结合卫星辅助的多头自注意力机制、自模仿学习和指纹技术，优化车辆间的连接管理。

Result: 仿真结果显示，MAAC-SAM在传输效用上比现有技术提升14%，并在不同车辆密度和信息共享水平下保持高估计精度。

Conclusion: MAAC-SAM为6G网络中动态连接管理提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks
is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial
observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with
Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage
connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the
integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state
estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among
vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and
fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions.
Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant
configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art
terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission
utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities
and sharing levels.

### [4] [Improving performance of content-centric networks via decentralized coded caching for multi-level popularity and access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01298)
*Azadeh Sadat Miraftab,Ahmadreza Montazerolghaem,Behrad Mahboobi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于内容中心网络（CCN）的改进架构，通过集成去中心化编码缓存（DCC）技术，优化数据存储和传输策略，从而提升网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的IP网络存在局限性，而CCN通过内容标识符直接寻址和路由，但仍有优化空间。DCC技术利用分布式缓存资源，进一步改善性能。

Method: 提出了一种改进的CCN架构，集成DCC技术，包括针对用户访问权限的差异化编码策略和路径上的数据重编码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了网络吞吐量、缓存命中率，并降低了内容交付延迟。

Conclusion: 通过DCC技术的集成，CCN架构在性能上实现了显著提升，为未来网络优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that
seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol
(IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication
approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing
and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance
improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of
coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching
(DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching
power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning
frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low
network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates
during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental
modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed
framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access
privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based
searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data
encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies
demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and
consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN
implementations.

### [5] [M3LLM: Model Context Protocol-aided Mixture of Vision Experts For Multimodal LLMs in Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01805)
*Yongjie Zeng,Hongyang Du*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: M3LLM通过分布式视觉专家和Model Context Protocol（MCP）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能，优化任务准确性和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM因集中式架构和固定视觉编码模块导致任务对齐不佳，限制了动态视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出M3LLM，利用MCP协议协调分布式视觉专家，并通过双流SAC算法和ASEM模块优化路由。

Result: 实验表明M3LLM提高了任务准确性，降低了通信成本，并增强了动态网络条件下的路由适应性。

Conclusion: M3LLM为分布式MLLM提供了一种高效、动态的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on centralized
architectures and often suffer from poor alignment between the input task and
their fixed visual encoding modules, which limits performance on diverse and
dynamic visual tasks. With the increasing deployment of resource-efficient
models on edge devices in wireless networks, a new opportunity emerges to
dynamically use distributed vision experts for improved MLLM inference quality.
To enable this, we propose M3LLM, where the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
coordinates a mixture of vision experts to achieve distributed MLLMs.
Specifically, MCP is an open protocol that structures the input task context
into interpretable representations, enabling wireless network-aware
coordination between the central model backbone and edge-hosted vision experts.
Based on the MCP representation, M3LLM formulates vision expert routing as a
joint optimization problem that balances task-expert semantic compatibility and
channel performance. To solve the resulting gradient conflicts, we develop a
dual-stream Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with decoupled reward signals and
introduce an Adaptive Stability Enhancement Module (ASEM) based on hierarchical
Bayesian modeling to ensure effective routing. Experiments show that M3LLM
improves task accuracy, reduces communication cost, and enhances expert routing
adaptability under dynamic wireless network conditions.

### [6] [Convolutions are Competitive with Transformers for Encrypted Traffic Classification with Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02001)
*Chungang Lin,Weiyao Zhang,Tianyu Zuo,Chao Zha,Yilong Jiang,Ruiqi Meng,Haitong Luo,Xuying Meng,Yujun Zhang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出NetConv，一种基于卷积的预训练模型，用于加密流量分类，解决了Transformer模型的效率低和扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的预训练模型在加密流量分类中存在效率低和扩展性差的问题，卷积模型虽有优势但性能不足。

Method: 提出NetConv，采用堆叠的流量卷积层，结合窗口级字节评分和序列级字节门控，设计连续字节掩码预训练任务。

Result: NetConv在四个任务中平均分类性能提升6.88%，模型吞吐量提高7.41倍。

Conclusion: 卷积模型在加密流量分类中具有竞争力，NetConv在性能和效率上均优于现有预训练模型。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

### [7] [PRIME: Plasticity-Robust Incremental Model for Encrypted Traffic Classification in Dynamic Network Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02031)
*Tian Qin,Guang Cheng,Zihan Chen,Yuyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出PRIME框架，通过动态调整模型参数规模解决加密流量分类中的增量学习可塑性下降问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络流量加密普及和新型服务/攻击变体出现，现有增量学习方法在加密流量分类中面临可塑性下降挑战。

Method: 提出PRIME框架，通过监测模型参数有效秩和不活跃神经元比例，动态调整参数规模以维持模型可塑性。

Result: 在多个加密流量数据集和增量场景下，PRIME性能显著优于其他增量学习算法，且参数规模增加最小。

Conclusion: PRIME框架有效解决了增量学习中的可塑性问题，为加密流量分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the continuous development of network environments and technologies,
ensuring cyber security and governance is increasingly challenging. Network
traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application
categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like
QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence
of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for
content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new
services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models.
To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential;
however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining
plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing
incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the
PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the
proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately
increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates.
Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different
category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly
better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in
parameter scale.

### [8] [Distillation-Enhanced Clustering Acceleration for Encrypted Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02282)
*Ziyue Huang,Chungang Lin,Weiyao Zhang,Xuying Meng,Yujun Zhang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: NetClus是一个结合预训练模型和蒸馏增强聚类加速的新框架，解决了加密流量分类中的计算延迟和新兴流量类型识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前加密流量分类系统存在两个主要问题：预训练模型的大规模架构导致推理速度慢，以及依赖标记数据限制了模型对新流量类型的适应性。

Method: NetClus通过引入聚类友好损失重塑潜在空间，并将模型蒸馏为轻量级前馈神经网络，同时利用启发式合并和新指标ASI验证聚类纯度。

Result: NetClus在保持分类性能下降低于1%的同时，实现了高达6.2倍的加速。

Conclusion: NetClus有效解决了加密流量分类中的计算效率和新兴流量类型识别问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service
management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models
as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic
classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models
typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive
parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational
latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these
models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel
traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these
challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models
with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus
first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space
for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills
the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain
semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear
runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to
identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked
against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration
while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.

### [9] [On Effectiveness of Graph Neural Network Architectures for Network Digital Twins (NDTs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02373)
*Iulisloi Zacarias,Oussama Ben Taarit,Admela Jukan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的网络数字孪生（AI-NDT），利用多层知识图谱架构和图神经网络预测网络指标，评估了四种GNN架构，其中GraphTransformer表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来网络（如6G）需要支持多样化的设备和应用，传统网络管理方法不足，自动化解决方案成为必需，但现有框架易出错且依赖训练。网络数字孪生可模拟和测试AI模型，不影响实际网络。

Method: 提出AI-NDT，采用多层知识图谱架构和GNN预测网络指标，评估四种GNN架构的性能，使用RIPE Atlas公开数据训练。

Result: GraphTransformer在四种GNN架构中表现最佳，其他架构在训练时间较短时也能提供可接受的结果。

Conclusion: AI-NDT为主动网络管理提供了可扩展且准确的解决方案，符合下一代网络需求。

Abstract: Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of
interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements.
While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated
solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone
to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to
learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins
are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI
models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents
an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered
knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network
metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation
of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was
conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We
trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE
Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world
applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated,
GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures
might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while
also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of
what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a
scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the
next-generation networks.

### [10] [ASINT: Learning AS-to-Organization Mapping from Internet Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02571)
*Yongzhe Xu,Weitong Li,Eeshan Umrani,Taejoong Chung*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ASINT是一个端到端管道，结合注册数据和网络来源，利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，更准确地映射自治系统（ASN）到其所属组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖WHOIS或PeeringDB，无法捕捉跨区域别名或父子所有权等复杂关系，导致组织映射不完整。

Method: ASINT融合批量注册数据和非结构化网络来源，采用RAG引导大型语言模型（LLM）推理，通过多阶段程序合并ASN为“组织家族”。

Result: ASINT映射了111,470个ASN到81,233个组织家族，识别了更多跨区域分组，提升了安全性和测量任务的准确性。

Conclusion: ASINT通过结合更广泛的网络证据，提供了更准确且可更新的互联网组织结构视图。

Abstract: Accurately mapping Autonomous Systems (ASNs) to their owning or operating
organizations underpins Internet measurement research and security
applications. Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or
PeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases,
parent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across
different RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that
fuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM)
inference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into
"organization families," capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler
heuristics.
  ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both
AS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g.,
operator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined
mappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5%
more intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack
alarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.
  Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection,
demonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving
view of the Internet's organizational structure.

### [11] [Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844)
*Christopher Wissuchek,Patrick Zschech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分类法，用于定义和比较具有不同认知和环境代理能力的AI系统，通过八维度和多阶段方法构建，并通过人机混合方法评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个结构化框架来分类和比较自主AI系统的代理能力，阻碍了对AI系统发展的评估和预测。

Method: 采用多阶段方法构建和优化分类法，引入八个维度定义AI系统的代理能力，并通过人机混合方法评估和提炼。

Result: 开发了一个分类框架，能够分析AI系统的不同代理水平，为评估当前系统和预测未来发展提供基础。

Conclusion: 该分类法为研究者和从业者提供了结构化视角，有助于理解AI系统的代理能力及其发展路径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [12] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的‘状态’形式化结构，通过‘分层状态网格’和‘中间元宇宙’概念，扩展了跨学科的理论基础，为智能定义和科学理论提供了数学严谨的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决‘状态’概念长期缺乏共识和形式化清晰定义的问题，为数学、物理和语言学等领域提供统一的理论基础。

Method: 引入‘分层状态网格’和‘中间元宇宙’概念，避免自引用和逻辑不一致，扩展跨宇宙理论至语言翻译和智能体集成。

Result: 提出了一个基于‘定义=状态’原则的元形式逻辑框架，适用于智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨学科的理论基础提供了数学严谨的统一框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了多阶段复杂任务中的测试时计算最优扩展问题，提出了AgentTTS框架，通过自主搜索优化模型和预算分配，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段任务的测试时扩展，而现实问题多为多阶段复杂任务，需为不同子任务分配特定能力和预算。

Method: 通过实验得出三个经验性见解，提出AgentTTS框架，利用LLM代理通过反馈驱动交互自主搜索最优分配。

Result: AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法及其他基于LLM的基线。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段复杂任务中的计算最优扩展提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [14] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模糊框架ff4ERA，用于量化伦理风险评分（ERS），以支持人工智能伦理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险评估（ERA）面临不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整等挑战，需要一种灵活透明的框架。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过ERS量化伦理风险。

Result: 案例研究表明ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感的伦理风险评分，验证了模型的稳健性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ff4ERA为伦理决策提供了可解释、可追踪的风险评估工具，支持假设分析和设计优化。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

TL;DR: 论文测试了大型语言模型（LLM）在风险决策中是否表现出与人类相似的‘前景理论’行为，发现LLM的行为与人类相似，且情境（如军事与民用）对风险偏好的影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Kahneman和Tversky的前景理论是否适用于大型语言模型，探索LLM在风险决策中的行为模式及其与人类认知的相似性。

Method: 通过实验测试LLM在不同情境（如军事与民用）下的风险决策行为，分析其是否符合前景理论的预测。

Result: LLM在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的前景理论行为，且情境（如军事场景）对风险偏好的影响更大。

Conclusion: 语言模型能够捕捉人类的启发式与偏见，但偏见的表现具有情境依赖性，支持了‘语言游戏’理论对LLM行为的解释。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化有效提升了多跳问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.

Result: 在DeepAccident基准测试中，碰撞率降低77%，VPQ达48.2%，推理延迟0.57秒。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM结合语言引导推理可提升自动驾驶的安全性和实时性。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 生成式AI的输出突然转向错误可能导致严重后果（如经济损失和人身伤害），因此需要研究其不稳定性的根源。

Method: 通过将AI映射到多自旋热系统，揭示其基本注意力单元的隐藏不稳定性，并推导出触发点的精确公式。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于提升AI的透明性、可解释性和性能，并为量化用户风险和法律责任提供了路径。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Conclusion: 多模态方法在财富预测中表现优越，LLM知识更具鲁棒性，并发布了大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Conclusion: H2C有效解决了轨迹预测中的持续学习问题，提升了模型在动态场景中的适应性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效解决情感冲突问题，提升模型性能，无模态间权衡。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Motivation: 探索CoT推理是否真的具有人类般的推理能力，还是仅仅是对训练数据的结构化归纳偏置。

Method: 通过数据分布视角研究CoT推理，设计DataAlchemy环境，从零训练LLM并系统测试其在不同分布条件下的表现。

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时表现脆弱，其有效性受限于训练数据与测试查询的分布差异。

Conclusion: CoT推理并非真正的通用推理能力，其成功依赖于数据分布的匹配，揭示了实现真正泛化推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Conclusion: BIS能显著降低评估成本，适用于代码生成任务中的基准开发和验证。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

TL;DR: SketchAgent是一个多智能体系统，旨在将手绘草图自动转换为结构化图表，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手绘草图虽直观高效，但缺乏结构约束和语义精确性，难以自动转换为机器可读图表。

Method: SketchAgent结合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，生成语义连贯且结构准确的图表。

Result: 提出Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含8类图表和6,000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计、教育和工程领域具有潜力，为草图与机器可读图表间的转换提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

TL;DR: MoE-MLA-RoPE结合了Mixture of Experts、Multi-head Latent Attention和Rotary Position Embeddings，通过细粒度专家路由、共享专家隔离和无梯度冲突负载平衡，实现了高效语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型容量与计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 64个微专家和top-k选择的细粒度路由；2. 共享专家隔离；3. 无梯度冲突负载平衡。

Result: KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，困惑度仅下降0.8%。验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数规模决定了资源受限语言模型的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在资源受限环境中具有高效性和可部署性，但其隐私和知识产权保护面临成员推断攻击的威胁。现有攻击方法在小型模型上效果较差，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种基于min-k的win-k攻击方法，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有攻击方法，尤其是在小型模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的成员推断攻击方法，特别适用于小型语言模型，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KCR的框架，通过强化学习训练LLMs解决长上下文中的知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，处理多源知识冲突的需求增加，但LLMs在长且冲突的上下文中表现不佳。

Method: KCR框架通过提取推理路径（文本或局部知识图谱），并利用强化学习奖励模型选择逻辑一致的上下文。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力。

Conclusion: KCR框架有效增强了LLMs处理知识冲突的能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Motivation: 现有基准在繁体中文的三模态评估和延迟方面存在不足，Multi-TW填补了这一空白。

Method: Multi-TW基于官方汉语水平测试构建，评估了多种多模态模型，包括端到端架构和视觉语言模型。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，开源模型在音频任务中表现良好；端到端架构延迟更低。

Conclusion: Multi-TW为多模态模型提供了全面评估，并指出繁体中文微调和高效架构的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个实用工具，有望推动新假设的发现。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

Motivation: LLM在规划任务中常生成错误或虚构的动作，现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对计划质量的全面分析。

Method: 提出一个包含NLP评估和三阶段恢复的流程，结合符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 研究发现LLM生成的计划缺乏底层推理，恢复流程仅将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%，且平均仅前2.65个动作可执行。

Conclusion: 尽管恢复流程有所改进，LLM生成的计划质量和可靠性仍不及传统规划器。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着LLM在各个领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题。现有方法多依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，效果有限。

Method: 设计三种字谜类型（单词搜索、变位词、填字游戏），要求LLM解谜后生成对有害指令的响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率为88.8%，其中GPT-4.1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet分别达到96.5%和92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单但强大的策略，利用LLM的推理能力，将熟悉的谜题转化为有效的越狱攻击手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: 人类将转向监督和整合AI的新职业，政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Motivation: 传统基于POI的预测方法无法捕捉探索行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 使用道路交叉点图表示轨迹，结合方向性POI聚合和结构图嵌入，采用Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer进行序列建模。

Result: 模型在准确率和MRR上显著优于基线，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了封闭世界假设的局限性，为城市移动性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车辆配送因电池容量有限需优化充电计划，以提高可持续物流效率。

Method: 提出MILP精确解和高效启发式方法，解决NP难问题。

Result: 相比基准策略，充电成本降低39%和22%，配送量相当。

Conclusion: CARGO框架有效解决电动车辆配送中的充电和路线规划问题。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为kTPG的多智能体速度优化算法，将MAPF计划优化为动力学可行的计划，并进一步开发了WinkTPG框架，动态调整计划以减少不确定性。实验表明其高效且优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体路径规划中动力学模型简化导致计划不可行的问题，同时考虑不确定性和碰撞避免。

Method: 提出kTPG算法优化MAPF计划为动力学可行计划，并开发WinkTPG框架，通过窗口机制动态调整计划。

Result: WinkTPG能在1秒内为1000个智能体生成速度曲线，解决方案质量提升高达51.7%。

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了多智能体路径规划中的动力学可行性和不确定性问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

TL;DR: Refine-n-Judge是一种自动迭代方法，利用单一LLM作为数据精炼器和评估器，无需人工标注即可提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈成本高且难以扩展，需自动化方法提升数据质量。

Method: LLM迭代生成改进并评估每次改进，直至无进一步优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，优化后的模型表现优于原始数据集训练的模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会继承人类认知偏见，尤其是在高风险的自主决策中，以及这些偏见的表现是否受特定条件触发。

Method: 通过四组实验（模型作为投资者、顾问、多智能体审议和复合压力情境）进行6,500次试验，分析LLMs在不同情境下的决策行为。

Result: LLMs在个体决策中表现理性，但在多智能体对称决策或压力情境下表现出显著的承诺升级现象。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见表现取决于社会和组织环境，这对多智能体系统和无人监督部署具有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Conclusion: LMs在表格数据准备中具有潜力，但仍需进一步系统化研究和实践验证。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中复杂、长期任务目标和安全约束的泛化问题，现有方法难以处理嵌套任务和不可行子目标的情况。

Method: 利用Büchi自动机结构分解LTL任务为子目标序列，通过安全强化学习逐个子目标解决，并引入观察缩减技术降低复杂度。

Result: GenZ-LTL在零样本泛化到未见LTL规范时显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和逐个子目标解决，实现了对任意LTL规范的高效零样本泛化。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态代理架构在复杂动态环境中的局限性，提供一种可实时调整行为的自适应框架。

Method: 基于组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，定义SPARK参数空间，利用LLMs参数化复杂空间并进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: 在五级复杂度的模拟实验中，PCF展示了代理的适应性和性能趋势，但在高复杂度下回报递减。

Conclusion: PCF为可扩展、动态且合乎逻辑的自适应AI代理设计提供了框架，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Motivation: 填补LLMs在定量化学推理能力方面的研究空白，系统评估其数学推理能力。

Method: 设计QCBench基准，包含7个化学子领域的350个问题，分为基础、中级和专家三个层次，强调逐步数值推理。

Result: 评估19个LLMs显示，随着任务复杂性增加，性能一致下降，揭示了语言流畅性与科学计算准确性之间的差距。

Conclusion: QCBench为未来改进（如领域自适应微调或多模态集成）奠定了基础，并揭示了LLMs在定量化学推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽略了知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊性、时间不敏感的检索和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图谱生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有RAG和GraphRAG基线。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对于稳健的长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过解决视觉、分布和上下文不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学报告生成（MRG）的临床部署受到视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性的限制，影响其可靠性和临床信任度。

Method: SURE-Med包含三个模块：Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling（修复视觉不确定性）、Token Sensitive Learning（平衡标签分布）、Contextual Evidence Filter（减少上下文幻觉）。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中，SURE-Med达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言生成可视化（NL2VIS）方法缺乏透明性，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化结果。

Method: 设计CoT推理流程，构建nvBench-CoT数据集，开发交互式界面DeepVIS。

Result: 定量评估、案例和用户研究表明，CoT框架显著提升NL2VIS质量。

Conclusion: CoT框架为NL2VIS提供了透明化和可优化的设计过程。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力和专家启发式方法，解决了动态柔性作业车间调度问题，显著优于直接LLM基线和传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态柔性作业车间调度（DFJSP）是一个NP难问题，传统方法效率低且不透明，直接应用LLM存在长上下文悖论、启发式利用不足和短视决策等问题。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，利用LLM分析启发式驱动的模拟结果，生成“战略经验”摘要，并集成到决策模块中，以指导非短视的调度决策。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基线（胜率71.35%，相对百分比偏差降低2.755%），并超越所有评估的启发式方法。

Conclusion: ReflecSched有效解决了LLM在DFJSP中的关键问题，性能与针对每个实例的最佳启发式方法相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释的概率推理框架，显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Method: 使用单一通用全局约束（Generalized Cumulative）和新的时间表过滤算法处理条件时间间隔任务。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，能有效建模生产者-消费者调度问题并扩展到大规模问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法填补了开源求解器的空白，为复杂调度问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用的形式化框架，用于分析和比较不同领域的推理系统，支持未来对推理架构的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立一个统一的结构化框架，以支持对推理系统的表示和比较，特别是在内部故障、适应或分裂可能发生的背景下。

Method: 将推理系统建模为结构化元组，包括现象、解释空间、推理和生成映射以及原则库，涵盖逻辑、算法和学习为基础的推理过程。

Result: 框架支持动态行为（如迭代优化和原则演化）和内部标准（如一致性、完备性），并列举了典型的失败模式。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为未来的理论和实践研究提供基础结构，而非提出具体的解决方案架构。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的自动化过程奖励数据构建框架，结合了多数投票与过程奖励模型的优势，提升了数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有构建高质量过程奖励数据的方法效率低下或劳动密集，限制了过程奖励模型（PRMs）的发展。

Method: 提出了不确定性驱动的自动化数据生成与标注框架，并引入两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法：混合多数奖励投票和加权奖励频率投票。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，新方法显著提升了PRMs的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法为PRMs的高效数据构建和性能提升提供了可行方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

TL;DR: LiveMCPBench是首个针对大规模MCP环境的综合基准测试，包含95个真实任务和70个服务器，支持自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器环境，无法有效评估大规模场景下的代理能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval评估框架，并设计MCP Copilot Agent。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率达78.95%，但模型间性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为动态、工具丰富的MCP环境提供了首个统一评估框架。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

Motivation: 云站点异常检测具有挑战性，现有方法因数据不平衡导致高误报率，增加了运维负担。LLM的进展为结合指标和日志数据提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CloudAnoAgent，联合处理结构化指标和文本日志数据，利用符号验证生成结构化异常报告。同时引入CloudAnoBench基准数据集。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent平均提升异常分类准确率46.36%和36.67%，降低误报率36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率提升12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent显著提升了异常检测的准确性、降低了误报率，并增强了可解释性，适用于企业云环境的实际部署。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

TL;DR: ProKG Dial是一个基于领域知识图谱（KG）的渐进式框架，用于构建高质量的多轮对话数据集，解决了现有方法资源密集或对话质量不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在专业领域缺乏精确性，而构建高质量的领域特定对话数据集对开发专业对话系统至关重要。

Method: ProKG Dial利用知识图谱的结构化特性，通过社区检测分割KG为语义子图，逐步生成围绕目标实体的问题和答案，并进行严格过滤。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上的验证表明，ProKG Dial显著提升了对话的多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖率，并通过微调LLM证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial在提升对话质量和领域特定性能方面表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

Motivation: 现有单轮NL2GQL方法无法有效处理多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖，且缺乏高质量多轮数据集。

Method: 利用LLMs自动构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发MTGQL数据集；提出三种基线方法评估效果。

Result: 成功构建了MTGQL数据集，并提出了评估多轮NL2GQL翻译的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来多轮NL2GQL研究奠定了基础，MTGQL数据集将公开供研究使用。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: SNOW是一个基于大语言模型的模块化多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自动生成结构化特征，无需人工干预，性能接近人工特征生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但提取有效特征仍具挑战性。现有方法要么依赖人工，要么缺乏可解释性和临床相关性。

Method: SNOW采用多代理系统，通过大语言模型自动完成特征发现、提取、验证、后处理和聚合，生成可解释的临床特征。

Result: 在预测5年前列腺癌复发的任务中，SNOW性能（AUC-ROC: 0.761）接近人工特征生成（0.771），显著优于基线（0.691）和其他自动化方法。

Conclusion: SNOW证明自主大语言模型系统可规模化复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 解决角色扮演对话系统中角色一致性和知识问答的挑战。

Method: 结合ACTS（自适应分块）、GS（引导选择）和AE（属性提取）组件，构建CharacterRAG数据集。

Result: 框架能有效建模角色知识和属性（如个性），提升角色一致性。

Conclusion: AMADEUS为RAG-based RPAs提供了有效的开发和评估工具。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

TL;DR: TraceAlign是一个框架，用于追踪大型语言模型（LLM）生成不安全内容的根源，并提出三种干预措施以减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLM在对抗性提示或解码扰动下产生不安全内容的问题，并揭示其训练时的根源。

Method: 提出TraceAlign框架，包括Belief Conflict Index（BCI）量化语义不一致性，以及三种干预措施：TraceShield、对比信念解冲突损失和Prov-Decode。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark（ADB）上减少85%的对齐漂移，同时保持标准任务的性能。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐失败提供了可扩展、可追踪的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Result: 实验显示GLM-4V的识别准确率提升至50%，提高了35.49%。

Conclusion: 该方法为风险检测提供了新的理论和实践支持，显著提升了准确性和上下文理解能力。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG框架通过结构化、激励对齐的协作，实现了可扩展且鲁棒的多智能体语言生成。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上测试，SE-Agent相对提升达55%，达到开源代理中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自我进化机制显著提升LLM代理的推理能力，为复杂任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家用户提供了一种高效、直观的3D结构生成方法。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方式——通过操纵工具元数据（如名称、描述等）来影响代理行为，称为“吸引性元数据攻击”（AMA）。实验表明攻击成功率高且隐蔽，揭示了当前代理架构的系统性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具完成任务，但工具元数据的操纵未被充分研究，可能成为新的攻击面。

Method: 提出AMA攻击框架，通过迭代优化生成高度吸引但合法的工具元数据，无需修改代理执行框架。

Result: 在多种场景和LLM代理中，攻击成功率高达81%-95%，且对主任务影响极小。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击方式，需开发执行级安全机制以弥补现有防御不足。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）的高效推理方法，重点解决了过度思考问题，并分类为单模型优化和多模型协作两大方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型推理模型（如DeepSeek R1）的广泛应用，过度思考问题（如冗余推理链）降低了推理效率和准确性，因此需要高效推理方法。

Method: 通过系统综述现有研究，将高效推理方法分为两类：单模型优化（提升单个模型的推理效率）和多模型协作（通过模型协作优化推理路径）。

Result: 论文总结了当前高效推理方法的研究进展，并维护了一个公开的GitHub仓库以跟踪最新动态。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的研究对于提升LRMs的推理效率和准确性具有重要意义，未来可进一步探索单模型和多模型协作的优化策略。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理系统虽灵活但易出现异常，亟需系统化运维方法。

Method: 定义异常类型并提出AgentOps框架，包含监控、检测、分析和解决四阶段。

Result: 建立了代理系统运维的清晰框架，明确了挑战和解决方案。

Conclusion: AgentOps为代理系统运维提供了系统性方法，促进其进一步发展。

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持信息完整性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中对长上下文建模的需求增加，但标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和位置感知稀疏注意力计算，实现双稀疏设计，减少计算复杂度并保留关键信息。

Result: DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中优于多头注意力等方法，并在1.7B参数模型中显著优于多头注意力。

Conclusion: DMA能有效平衡模型效率和长上下文建模能力，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感弧线是跨文化和媒介的普遍叙事结构，但如何将其操作化并应用于游戏叙事生成尚未充分探索。

Method: 结合叙事学理论和实证分析，以情感弧线为结构框架，自动生成故事节点及其相关属性，并通过LLM和自适应生成技术实现。

Result: 原型ARPG实验显示，情感弧线集成显著提升了玩家的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感冲击力。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的过程生成在交互式叙事中具有巨大潜力，为游戏叙事设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving but exhibit a concerning
trade off between reasoning capabilities and instruction following abilities.
Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger
external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations
including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a
self-supervised RL framework that leverages reasoning models' own internal
signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external
supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning
performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance
instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双惩罚强化学习框架，通过区分内部冗余和外部冗余来减少大型推理模型的冗余推理步骤，显著压缩推理轨迹且几乎不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）常因过度推理（overthinking）产生冗长的推理轨迹，影响效率和可解释性。现有方法仅关注减少响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 将过度推理分解为内部冗余（FCS内的低贡献推理步骤）和外部冗余（FCS后的不必要延续）。采用滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余，并通过比例惩罚外部冗余以鼓励提前终止。

Result: 方法显著压缩推理轨迹且准确性损失极小，在问答和代码生成等任务中泛化良好。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎减少以避免影响正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升推理效率，还实现了对推理长度的语义感知控制，为更简洁、可解释的LRMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Motivation: 人工神经网络在灵活性和通用智能方面存在局限，源于其与生物认知的根本差异，特别是忽略了功能专门化和时间动态协调。

Method: 提出了一种三部分架构（感知、辅助、执行系统），并结合多频神经振荡和突触动态适应机制。

Result: 在视觉任务中，性能优于现有时间处理方法，准确率提升2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，且更符合人类置信模式。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Result: 在随机网格世界和部分可观察的Minigrid任务中，EFE最小化代理表现优于传统KL控制代理。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了认知先验在不确定环境下高效探索和规划的优势。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3等模型能生成高流量且操作真实的场景，支持迭代优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为ATC训练提供了可扩展的自动化方案，展示了LLMs在安全关键领域的潜力。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Result: 实验表明PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架有效提升LLM推理的可控性和可解释性，减少冗余和幻觉。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的方法，通过参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，结合指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA），实现了新生儿MRI扫描中月经后年龄（PMA）的准确预测和临床相关解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在PMA预测中缺乏透明性和可解释性的问题，同时保持高准确性。

Method: 采用Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型，通过PEFT策略（指令调优和LoRA）进行微调，使用四种2D皮质表面投影图进行训练。

Result: 模型预测误差的95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周，并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在新生儿神经科学中实现了透明且可信的AI系统，为临床决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

TL;DR: CAMA是一个两阶段因果框架，通过构建数学因果图（MCG）和动态提取任务相关子图，显著提升大语言模型（LLM）在复杂数学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种任务中表现优异，但在复杂数学推理上仍有不足，主要源于深层结构依赖问题。

Method: CAMA分为学习阶段（构建MCG并通过反馈优化）和推理阶段（动态提取任务相关子图并注入LLM）。

Result: 实验表明，CAMA显著提升LLM在数学问题上的性能，结构化指导优于非结构化方法，非对称因果关系比对称关联更有效。

Conclusion: CAMA通过显式、可重用的数学结构，有效解决了LLM在复杂数学推理中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Result: 实验表明，HealthFlow的自进化方法显著优于现有代理框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者向自进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 研究旨在解释人类为何在特定条件下对AI系统产生类似对人类的认知投射，并探讨其背后的机制。

Method: 通过多学科框架分析，结合LLM的意义整体论和LLM上下文认知场的技术概念，揭示AI如何通过语言表现和复杂性模拟能动性。

Conclusion: 论文总结了Noosemia的哲学、认识论和社会意义，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Motivation: 探索AI代理在在线市场中的购物行为及其对市场动态的影响。

Method: 开发ACES沙盒环境，通过随机化产品属性（如价格、评分等）研究VLM代理的购物行为。

Result: AI代理表现出强烈的偏好差异，对赞助标签和平台推荐有不同反应，且卖家可通过优化描述获取市场份额。

Conclusion: AI代理的行为将重塑电子商务，引发卖家策略、平台设计和监管的新问题。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖敏感或私有数据的问题，同时在高风险场景中提升公平性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升政策公平性和效率方面具有潜力，尤其在涉及多变量交互的高风险场景中。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Motivation: 扩散策略在处理高维空间中的多模态动作分布时表现出色，但存在表示崩溃问题，导致对细微但关键的变化处理能力不足。

Method: 提出D2PPO，通过分散损失正则化将批次内的所有隐藏表示视为负对，迫使网络学习区分性表示。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，D2PPO在预训练和微调后分别实现了22.7%和26.1%的平均提升，并在真实机器人实验中表现出高成功率。

Conclusion: D2PPO在复杂任务中表现尤为突出，为扩散策略在机器人操作中的应用提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: The differential-linear connectivity table (DLCT), introduced by Bar-On et
al. at EUROCRYPT'19, is a novel tool that captures the dependency between the
two subciphers involved in differential-linear attacks. This paper is devoted
to exploring the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions. First, by
refining specific exponential sums, we propose two classes of power functions
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ with low differential-linear uniformity (DLU). Next, we
further investigate the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions
that are polynomials by utilizing power functions with known DLU. Specifically,
by combining a cubic function with quadratic functions, and employing
generalized cyclotomic mappings, we construct several classes of
$(n,n)$-functions with low DLU, including some that achieve optimal or
near-optimal DLU compared to existing results.

Abstract: The advent of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
provided new opportunities for capacity improvement via strategic antenna
deployment, especially when the near-field effect is pronounced due to antenna
proliferation. In this paper, we investigate the optimal antenna placement for
maximizing the achievable rate of a point-to-point near-field channel, where
the transmitter is deployed with massive movable antennas. First, we propose a
novel design framework to explore the relationship between antenna positions
and achievable data rate. By introducing the continuous antenna position
function (APF) and antenna density function (ADF), we reformulate the antenna
position design problem from the discrete to the continuous domain, which
maximizes the achievable rate functional with respect to ADF. Leveraging
functional analysis and variational methods, we derive the optimal ADF
condition and propose a gradient-based algorithm for numerical solutions under
general channel conditions. Furthermore, for the near-field line-of-sight (LoS)
scenario, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal ADF, revealing the
critical role of edge antenna density in enhancing the achievable rate.
Finally, we propose a flexible antenna array-based deployment method that
ensures practical implementation while mitigating mutual coupling issues.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,
with uniform circular arrays emerging as a promising geometry for balancing
performance and deployment feasibility in near-field communications.

Conclusion: ToMA阵列通过动态几何重构和优化APV，为机载通信系统提供了更高的安全性和性能增益。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture
to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems.
Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the
ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by
distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space
surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the
effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering
superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure
transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple
legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure
security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward
eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and
eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized
to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case
of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure
that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,
we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging
Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA
arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to
users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.

Abstract: Constant-dimension subspace codes (CDCs), a special class of subspace codes,
have attracted significant attention due to their applications in network
coding. A fundamental research problem of CDCs is to determine the maximum
number of codewords under the given parameters. The paper first proposes the
construction of parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes
(FDRMCs) by employing the list of CDCs and inverse list of CDCs. Then a new
class of CDCs is obtained by combining the parallel cosets of optimal FDRMCs
with parallel linkage construction. Next, we present a novel set of identifying
vectors and provide a new construction of CDCs via the multilevel constuction.
Finally, the coset construction is inserted into the multilevel construction
and three classes of large CDCs are provided, one of which is constructed by
using new optimal FDRMCs. Our results establish at least 65 new lower bounds
for CDCs with larger sizes than the previously best known codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于接收器的非线性特性，带限直接检测信道的容量难以计算或逼近，因此需要一种高效且复杂度可控的检测方法。

Method: 设计了GVAMP检测器，结合多级编码和连续干扰消除技术，应用于具有长符号间干扰的光纤信道。

Result: 双极性调制在光放大链路中接近理论容量（差距0.3 bpcu），功率效率比单极性调制高6 dB。GVAMP的复杂度显著低于现有神经网络方法。

Conclusion: GVAMP检测器在性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡，适用于实际光纤信道，并能适应信道参数的变化。

Abstract: The capacity of bandlimited direct-detection channels is difficult to compute
or approach because of the receiver nonlinearity. A generalized vector
approximate message passing (GVAMP) detector is designed to achieve high rates
with reasonable complexity. The rates increase by using multi-level coding and
successive interference cancellation. The methods are applied to optical fiber
channels with long intersymbol interference, as encountered in practice.
Bipolar modulation operates within 0.3 bits per channel use (bpcu) of the
real-alphabet coherent capacity for optically-amplified links, improving the
best existing gap of 1 bpcu based on theory. Remarkably, bipolar modulation
gains 6 decibels (dB) in power efficiency over unipolar modulation, and 3 dB
for unamplified links. The detector is robust to changes in channel parameters
such as the fiber length. The GVAMP complexity, measured in multiplications per
information bit (mpib), is proportional to the number of iterations and the
logarithm of the block length, and is substantially less than state-of-the-art
neural networks. The receiver requires approximately 38 iterations to achieve a
rate of 5 bpcu with 80 mpib.

Result: 针对特定函数类的FCLC构造在某些情况下是最优的，且相比传统方法能显著减少冗余。

Conclusion: FCLC在保护函数正确性的同时，能有效减少冗余，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Function-Correcting Codes (FCCs) are a novel class of codes designed to
protect function evaluations of messages against errors while minimizing
redundancy. A theoretical framework for systematic FCCs to channels matched to
the Lee metric has been studied recently, which introduced function-correcting
Lee codes (FCLCs) and also derived upper and lower bounds on their optimal
redundancy. In this paper, we propose a Plotkin-like bound for irregular
Lee-distance codes, which improves an existing bound. We construct explicit
FCLCs for specific classes of functions, including the Lee weight, Lee weight
distribution, modular sum, and locally bounded function. For these functions,
lower bounds on redundancy are obtained, and our constructions are shown to be
optimal in certain cases. Finally, a comparative analysis with classical Lee
error-correcting codes and codes correcting errors in function values
demonstrates that FCLCs can significantly reduce redundancy while preserving
function correctness.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the
fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the
RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless
propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer
to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which
the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to
minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve
this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating
optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all
optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system
parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training
and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is
performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the
channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the
other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and
receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth
transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI
acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently,
we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial
diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that
the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves
satisfactory classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 首次建立了植入子图检测的鲁棒框架，为半随机模型和计算-统计权衡研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Abstract: This paper studies the sequence reconstruction problem for a channel inspired
by protein identification. We introduce a coloring channel, where a sequence is
transmitted through a channel that deletes all symbols not belonging to a fixed
subset (the coloring) of the alphabet. By extending this to a coloring profile,
a tuple of distinct colorings, we analyze the channel's information rate and
capacity. We prove that optimal (i.e., achieving maximum information rate)
coloring profiles correspond to 2-covering designs and identify the minimal
covering number required for maximum information rate, as well as the minimum
number for which any coloring profile is optimal.

advancements in LAM applications for physical layer communications, addressing
limitations of conventional AI-based approaches. LAM applications are
classified into two strategies: leveraging pre-trained LAMs and developing
native LAMs designed specifically for physical layer tasks. The motivations and
key frameworks of these approaches are comprehensively examined through
multiple use cases. Both strategies significantly improve performance and
adaptability across diverse wireless scenarios. Future research directions,
including efficient architectures, interpretability, standardized datasets, and
collaboration between large and small models, are proposed to advance LAM-based

*Yang Li,Martianus Frederic Ezerman,Huimin Lao,San Ling*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了非GRS MDS码和NMDS码的性质，解决了关于TGRS和ETGRS码的两个关键问题：确定哪些码是非GRS MDS码，以及改进其解码算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非GRS MDS码和NMDS码在通信、密码学和存储系统中有广泛应用，但现有研究存在空白，需要进一步探索其性质和优化解码方法。

Method: 通过分析TGRS和ETGRS码的结构，解决了两个问题：一是确定非GRS MDS码的类别，二是提出改进的解码算法。

Result: 发现了两类非GRS MDS Hermitian自对偶TGRS码，证明了不存在Galois自对偶ETGRS码，并提出了一种优于现有算法的ETGRS码解码方法。

Conclusion: 研究填补了非GRS MDS码和NMDS码的空白，为实际应用提供了理论支持和解码优化方案。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized
Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are called non-GRS MDS codes. Alongside near MDS
(NMDS) codes, they are applicable in communication, cryptography, and storage
systems. From theoretical perspective, it is particularly intriguing to
investigate families of linear codes in which each element can be determined to
be either a non-GRS MDS or an NMDS code. Two promising candidates for such
families emerge from what is known as twisted GRS (TGRS) construction. These
candidates are the $(+)$-TGRS codes and their extended versions, called
$(+)$-extended TGRS (ETGRS) codes.
  Although many of their properties have been characterized, there are gaps to
fill. Which among the codes are non-GRS MDS? Can we improve on their decoding
by using their error-correcting pairs or deep holes? In this paper we solve
these problems. The answer to the first problem leads us to two classes of
non-GRS MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes and a proof that there is no Galois
self-dual ETGRS code. Addressing the second problem, we present an explicit
decoding algorithm for ETGRS codes that outperforms existing decoding
algorithms given some conditions. By considering the duals of TGRS codes which
are MDS, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes of the
recently constructed non-GRS MDS codes due to Han and Zhang.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电信系统能够定位用户和物体，引发隐私担忧。单天线发射器通过信号混淆技术防止未授权定位，但仅对单天线接收器有效。

Method: 基于盲多通道识别概念，提出一种简单的CSI恢复方法，用于多天线接收器提取信道特征，确保可靠的用户定位。

Result: 通过实际信道测量，评估信号混淆和恢复方法对CSI指纹、信道图表和三角定位性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要进一步努力保护用户位置隐私，防止基于无线电的敌对定位系统。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

the minimum length, and discuss the asymptotic behaviour of this parameter. We
also compute its value for several parameter sets. The paper also offers
insights into the "correct" list size to consider for the Functional Batch
Conjecture over non-binary finite fields, and establishes various supporting
results.

*Irtiza Hasan,Ahmed Arafa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RC-Gossip的智能信息传播机制，通过动态调整传播速率，显著提高了集群网络中节点的信息新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集群网络中节点如何保持与源节点信息同步，通过改进传统gossip机制，提升信息新鲜度。

Method: 提出RC-Gossip机制，根据网络中新鲜节点数量动态调整传播速率，并采用基于更新奖励的分析方法。

Result: RC-Gossip在不同集群网络中显著提高了节点信息新鲜度，且存在最优集群大小。

Conclusion: RC-Gossip机制优于传统gossip技术，能有效提升集群网络的信息新鲜度。

Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its
information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through
clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as
fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we
assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart
mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip
(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that
need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number
of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System
(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we
present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based
approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness
of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared
to traditional gossiping techniques.
