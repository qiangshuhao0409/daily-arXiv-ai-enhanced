This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT scheme to support batteryless sensor (BLS) networks in remote areas. In this system, BLSs harvest energy from the UAV and utilize the harvested energy to transmit the collected data back to the UAV. The goal is to maximize the collected data volume and fairness index while minimizing the UAV energy consumption. To achieve these objectives, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV trajectory.

This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur.

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings."}

To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes.

However, practical implementations of DNA storage are constrained by errors introduced during synthesis, preservation, and sequencing processes, and traditional error-correcting codes remain vulnerable to noise levels that exceed predefined thresholds. Here, we developed a Partitioning-mapping with Jump-rotating (PJ) encoding scheme, which exhibits exceptional noise resilience. PJ removes cross-strand information dependencies so that strand loss manifests as localized gaps rather than catastrophic file failure. It prioritizes file decodability under arbitrary noise conditions and leverages AI-based inference to enable controllable recovery of digital information. For the intra-strand encoding, we develop a jump-rotating strategy that relaxes sequence constraints relative to conventional rotating codes and provides tunable information density via an adjustable jump length. Based on this encoding architecture, the original file information can always be decoded and recovered under any strand loss ratio, with fidelity degrading smoothly as damage increases. We demonstrate that original files can be effectively recovered even with 10% strand loss, and machine learning datasets stored under these conditions retain their classification performance. Experiments further confirmed that PJ successfully decodes image files after extreme environmental disturbance using accelerated aging and high-intensity X-ray irradiation. By eliminating reliance on prior error probabilities, PJ establishes a general framework for robust, archival DNA storage capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of real-world preservation."}

We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option.

For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate. Finally, two extensions are outlined - one concerns the case of side information available to both encoder and decoder, and the other is for lossy compression."}

In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models."}

Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes.

By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking."}

A key invariance in the busy phase collapses the dynamics onto a one-dimensional busy-start boundary, reducing preemption control to an optimal stopping problem. Building on this structure, we develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm with heavy-tail acceleration, employing a hybrid (uniform/log-spaced) action grid and a far-field linear closure. Simulations under Pareto and log-normal service times demonstrate substantial improvements over AoI-optimal non-preemptive sampling and zero-wait baselines, achieving up to a 30x reduction in average cost in heavy-tailed regimes. Finally, simulations uncover a counterintuitive insight: under preemption, delay variance, despite typically being a liability, can become a strategic advantage for information freshness."}

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning.

At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update.

Traditional sector-search-based beam alignment algorithms rely on sequential sampling to identify the best sector, resulting in a significant latency burden on 6G communication systems. Recently proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms based on the active learning framework address the problem, aiming to identify the optimal sector with the fewest possible samples under an identical sector partition. Nevertheless, these algorithms either lack feasibility (Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi, JSAC 2019) due to ideal assumptions or lack interpretability (Sohrabi, Chen and Yu, JSAC 2021) due to the use of end-to-end black-box neural networks. To avoid ideal assumptions and maintain interpretability, we address all above problems by proposing an adaptive beam alignment algorithm using the framework of noisy twenty questions estimation with a trained questioner. Specifically, we use two methods for training the questioner to eliminate reliance on ideal assumptions. The first method maps queries of twenty questions estimation to beamforming vectors via weighted summation of steering vectors, as an initial attempt to address the feasibility problem encountered in prior pioneering study by Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi (JSAC 2019). The second method uses multi-layer fully connected neural networks to achieve improved performance while only employing them to train the questioner, which can effectively mitigate the interpretability issues in prior study by Sohrabi, Chen and Yu (JSAC 2021). Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform all benchmark algorithms."}

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods."}

Specifically, in twenty questions estimation, there are two players: an oracle and a questioner. The questioner aims to estimate target variables by posing queries to the oracle that knows the variables and using noisy responses to form reliable estimates. Typically, there are adaptive and non-adaptive query procedures. In adaptive querying, one designs the current query using previous queries and their noisy responses while in non-adaptive querying, all queries are posed simultaneously. Generally speaking, adaptive query procedures yield better performance. However, adaptive querying leads to privacy concerns, which were first studied by Tsitsiklis, Xu and Xu (COLT 2018) and by Xu, Xu and Yang (AISTATS 2021) for the noiseless case, where the oracle always provides correct answers to queries. In this paper, we generalize the above results to the more practical noisy case, by proposing a two-stage private query procedure, analyzing its non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic achievable performance and discussing the impact of privacy concerns. Furthermore, when specialized to the noiseless case, our private query procedure achieves better performance than above-mentioned query procedures (COLT 2018, AISTATS 2021)."}

In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation."}

This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling.
