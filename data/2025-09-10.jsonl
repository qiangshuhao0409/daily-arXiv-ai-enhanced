Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty\ninherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this\nuncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria\ndecision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and\nfuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the\nproblem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization\nof fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method\nis proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is\ncombined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was\napplied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for\nchoosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable\nsources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global\nclimate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even\nthough selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial\nand political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed\nin this study."}

Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear\ncode $C \\leq \\mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\\perp :=\\{x \\in\n\\mathcal{F}_2^n:\\forall c \\in C, \\langle x,c\\rangle=0\\}$ are asymptotically\ngood (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are\nencodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications\nmore broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure\ncomputation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda\net al (CCS 2025, to appear).\n  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast\ngood dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA)\ncodes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2\ncode, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps --\nwhere first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the\nprefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative\nsteps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and\nafterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these\ntwo operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code\nis very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.\n  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and\nFagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the\ninput-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a\ngiven weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new\nchallenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix\n(which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by\ncareful case analysis."}

This restricts their\nability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures\nsuch as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework\nthat extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables\nmulti-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components\nto be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot\nhandle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic\nrepresentations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in\nplanning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN\nexpressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures\ncomplex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy\nsystems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to\ngraph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible\nframework for neural-symbolic integration."}

While self-correction methods\noffer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent\nlimitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error\nlocalization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional\nnext-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose\nFeedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user\nfeedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response\nregeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing\nerror propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally\ncorrect outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,\nwhich enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through\ndelayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making\ncharacteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on\nmathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our\nframework achieves consistent and significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods."}

The second\ntrack, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which\nare decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step\nreasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten\nfrontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these\nsystems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.\nThese results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and\nactual Olympiad-level reasoning.

These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a\npowerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the\nreasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,\ntrustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in\ndomains where both accuracy and computational cost matter."}

Using a novel dataset,\nEduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance\non various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic\ndiscussions.

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation.

Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks.
