This research is motivated by\ntwo critical challenges: limited coverage provided by mmWave frequencies and\nhigh infrastructure costs associated with current technologies. IRSs can help\neliminate these issues because they can reflect electromagnetic waves to\nenhance signal propagation, thereby reducing blockages and extending network\ncoverage. However, deploying a separate IRS for each mobile network operator\n(MNO) can result in inefficiencies, redundant infrastructure, potential\nconflicts over placement, and interoperator interference. To address these\nchallenges, in this study, an IRS sharing system is proposed in which multiple\nMNOs collaborate to use a common IRS infrastructure. This approach not only\nenhances network flexibility and reduces costs but also minimizes the effect of\ninteroperator interference. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that IRS\nsharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming\nMNO-specific deployment methods in multi-MNO scenarios. This study provides\ninsights into the potential of IRS sharing to support sustainable 6G networks,\nthereby contributing to the efficient deployment and operation of\nnext-generation wireless communication systems."}

In other words, R\nexpresses the relative position of a sequence within the global entropy\nspectrum, assigning values close to 0 for highly ordered sequences and close to\n1 for highly disordered ones. DNA sequences are partitioned into fixed-length\nsubsequences and non-overlapping n-mer groups; frequency vectors become ordered\ninteger partitions and a combinatorial framework is used to derive the complete\nentropy distribution.

The next frontier is\nAI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,\nand evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and\nstakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,\nReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision\nachievable.\n  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for\nreasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers\n(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,\nGeneration, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a\nmulti-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions\nrequire explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying\nnormative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),\nand explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that\nstatistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with\nstatistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark\nevaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework\nshows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring\nsolution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over\ntrade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with\ncomputational reasoning capabilities."}
