### [1] [Energy-Efficient RSMA-enabled Low-altitude MEC Optimization Via Generative AI-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12910)
*Xudong Wang,Hongyang Du,Lei Feng,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.NI

Abstract: The growing demand for low-latency computing in 6G is driving the use of
UAV-based low-altitude mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. However, limited
spectrum often leads to severe uplink interference among ground terminals
(GTs). In this paper, we investigate a rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA)-enabled low-altitude MEC system, where a UAV-based edge server assists
multiple GTs in concurrently offloading their tasks over a shared uplink. We
formulate a joint optimization problem involving the UAV 3D trajectory, RSMA
decoding order, task offloading decisions, and resource allocation, aiming to
mitigate multi-user interference and maximize energy efficiency. Given the high
dimensionality, non-convex nature, and dynamic characteristics of this
optimization problem, we propose a generative AI-enhanced deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we embed a
diffusion model into the actor network to generate high-quality action samples,
improving exploration in hybrid action spaces and avoiding local optima. In
addition, a priority-based RSMA decoding strategy is designed to facilitate
efficient successive interference cancellation with low complexity. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed method for low-altitude MEC systems
outperforms baseline methods, and that integrating GDM with RSMA can achieve
significantly improved energy efficiency performance.

### [2] [RIDAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI-RAN with Representation- and Intention-Driven Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13140)
*Kuiyuan Ding,Caili Guo,Yang Yang,Jianzhang Guo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: RIDAS是一个多智能体框架，通过表示驱动代理（RDA）和意图驱动代理（IDA）优化6G网络中的资源配置，显著提升用户容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方案难以弥合高层用户意图与低层参数化配置之间的差距，6G网络需要更高效的AI集成以满足QoS和资源效率需求。

Method: RIDAS框架包含RDA（提供可调参数接口）和IDA（基于LLM的两阶段规划方案），将用户意图映射为最优配置。

Result: 实验显示，RIDAS在相同QoS约束下比WirelessAgent多支持44.71%的用户。

Conclusion: RIDAS能有效捕获用户意图并优化资源配置，适用于AI驱动的无线接入网络。

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial
intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality
of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions
struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level,
parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this
challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation
driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open
interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling
explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs
a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven
by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into
optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 44.71\%
more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results
validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more
efficiently in AI RAN environments.

TL;DR: 6G网络为XR应用提供了低延迟和边缘处理能力，使得计算密集型任务可以迁移到网络中，从而降低设备电池需求并实现更小尺寸的设备设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索6G网络如何通过低延迟和边缘处理能力支持XR应用的卸载，以提升用户体验和设备设计灵活性。

Method: 利用6G的低延迟和边缘处理基础设施，将计算密集型任务（如渲染）从用户设备迁移到网络。

Abstract: As 6G networks are developed and defined, offloading of XR applications is
emerging as one of the strong new use cases. The reduced 6G latency coupled
with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic
offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally
intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and
into the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery
needs in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with
smaller form factors.

### [4] [Bidirectional Age of Incorrect Information: A Performance Metric for Status Updates in Virtual Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13312)
*Chiara Schiavo,Manuele Favero,Alessandro Buratto,Leonardo Badia*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出双向错误信息年龄（BAoII）来量化虚拟动态环境中因信息不准确或过时而导致的惩罚，并通过马尔可夫链模型推导出长期BAoII的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟动态环境（如元宇宙和数字孪生）需要准确且实时地表示交互实体，以确保无缝交互和系统可靠性。

Method: 提出BAoII概念，扩展了单向错误信息年龄，采用连续时间马尔可夫链模型推导闭式解，并确定最优更新策略的传输成本阈值。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了模型，展示了BAoII对系统性能评估的影响，并强调了其在元宇宙和数字孪生实时协作中的重要性。

Conclusion: BAoII为虚拟动态环境中的信息更新策略提供了理论支持，平衡了通信成本和信息新鲜度，适用于实时协作场景。

Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins
(DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their
characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these
representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and
system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect
information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent
penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about
itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of
age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange,
capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own
representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities
share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model,
we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a
transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a
trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our
model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on
evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time
collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该平台为AI教育领域提供了模块化且高效的教学系统，尤其在数学教育中有显著贡献。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Result: 模型在真实数据集上验证了复杂交互的再现性，并在高保真仿真环境中表现出高效计算性能。

Conclusion: 该模型为自动驾驶开发提供了可扩展且解释性强的仿真工具。

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Result: 通过分类法梳理了XRL领域的研究现状，并提出了未来需要关注的方向。

Conclusion: XRL领域需要进一步研究，分类法为未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Result: 实验表明，LMM能够基于RL代理的行为数据迭代优化游戏机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助游戏设计提供了实用且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Result: 发现现有欺骗探针在白盒监控下表现略优于黑盒监控，效果较弱但有潜力。

Conclusion: 现有欺骗探针在检测AI助手欺骗性回答方面仍有改进空间，但初步结果令人鼓舞。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [16] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VAR-MATH框架，通过符号化评估揭示RL训练的LLMs在数学推理中的局限性，发现其性能在符号化版本中显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在数学推理上的改进可能仅是过拟合基准测试模式，而非真实推理能力的提升。

Method: 引入VAR-MATH框架，将固定数值问题转化为符号模板，要求模型解决多个实例以评估一致性。

Result: RL训练模型在符号化版本中性能大幅下降（AMC23下降48.0%，AIME24下降58.3%）。

Conclusion: VAR-MATH提供了一种抗污染、更稳健的数学推理评估方法，揭示了现有RL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标导向推理，同时保持PEC的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中推理动作及其效果时具有优势，但缺乏目标导向推理机制。

Method: 通过将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，引入“动作执行情境”概念，保留PEC的灵活动作语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习策略映射回可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP扩展了PEC的能力，同时保持了其可解释性，为算法和理论工具的应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

TL;DR: X-MILP是一种基于约束推理技术的领域无关方法，用于为混合整数线性规划（MILP）生成对比解释，通过构建“原因图”帮助用户理解查询答案的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可信AI的需求增加，研究针对MILP的对比解释技术变得重要，以增强决策过程的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 将用户查询编码为额外约束，通过计算不可约不可行子系统（IIS）确定答案原因，并构建“原因图”表示解释。

Result: 在经典优化问题实例上测试，验证了计算解释的实证难度。

Conclusion: X-MILP提供了一种有效的方法，通过约束推理和图形化表示，增强MILP解决方案的可解释性。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型在复杂问题推理中存在错误传播和知识整合问题，静态树状推理方法（如ProbTree）虽能缓解这些问题，但存在动态适应性和计算效率的局限。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，实时构建推理树，基于置信度估计选择最优策略（分解、检索或聚合），实现选择性扩展和资源分配。

Result: 新方法在保持概率严谨性的同时，提升了推理质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为树状推理提供了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和实际问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

*Matthew E. Brophy*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估大型语言模型（LLMs）作为人工道德代理（AMAs）的功能性标准，以应对传统伦理标准的不适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的随机输出和不透明内部状态，传统伦理标准已不适用，需要修订新的评估框架。

Method: 提出了十项功能性标准，并通过模拟道德代理（SMA-LLS）和自动驾驶公交车（APB）的假设场景进行说明。

Result: 新标准包括道德一致性、上下文敏感性等，旨在指导LLMs更好地与社会道德需求对齐。

Conclusion: 修订后的标准为LLMs的道德评估提供了实用指南，促进其社会整合。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及抽象函数和谓词推理的决策任务中，结合高阶理论和模糊逻辑可以提高效率，但现有方法复杂且难以实现。

Result: 算法能够计算最一般的统一子，并在可统一时提供最高近似度。

Conclusion: 该算法为高阶模糊推理提供了一种高效且可靠的方法。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEA（Generative Energy Arena）的新方法，通过公开竞技场让用户评估大型语言模型（LLMs），并考虑模型的能耗信息。初步结果显示，用户在了解能耗后更倾向于选择更小、更节能的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLMs的自动化基准方法存在与人类评价相关性低的问题，而传统人类评估方法又面临可扩展性和成本问题。此外，LLMs的能耗问题日益重要，需要研究能耗如何影响用户选择。

Method: 提出GEA，一个公开竞技场，用户可以在评估模型时看到能耗信息，并据此对模型进行排名。

Result: 初步结果表明，用户在了解能耗后更倾向于选择更小、更节能的模型，而非性能更高但能耗更大的模型。

Conclusion: GEA提供了一种结合能耗信息的LLMs评估方法，显示用户更注重节能而非性能提升，为未来模型设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案优于传统固定天线系统，PSO策略在位置不确定性下有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为高频率通信系统中的鲁棒资源分配提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for
reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency
communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically
placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)
connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although
recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted
designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an
impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust
resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with
uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit
power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we
address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position
and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method
combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the
multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using
a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting
non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna
systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement
strategy under location uncertainty.

Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective approach for semantic
communication. However, current JSCC methods are difficult to integrate with
existing communication network architectures, where application and network
providers are typically different entities. Recently, a novel paradigm termed
Split DeepJSCC has been under consideration to address this challenge. Split
DeepJSCC employs a bit-level interface that enables separate design of source
and channel codes, ensuring compatibility with existing communication networks
while preserving the advantages of JSCC in terms of semantic fidelity and
channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a learning-based interface
design by treating its parameters as trainable, achieving improved end-to-end
performance compared to Split DeepJSCC. In particular, the interface enables
specification of bit-level importance at the output of the source code.
Furthermore, we propose an Importance-Aware Net that utilizes the
interface-derived bit importance information, enabling dynamical adaptation to
diverse channel bandwidth ratios and time-varying channel conditions.
Experimental results show that our method improves performance in wireless
image transmission tasks. This work provides a potential solution for realizing
semantic communications in existing wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该研究为近场ISAC系统提供了一种高效的鲁棒波束成形设计方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field
secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple
communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers.
Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the
minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the
maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit
power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a
low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert
semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint
relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical
results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the
existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it
significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.

Conclusion: PA辅助的ISAC方案在感知性能和通信保密性方面显著优于传统系统。

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a
secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The
underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base
station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users
while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims
at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while
being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is
to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the
legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is
provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and
total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme
through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC
system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with
equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide
gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system
with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.

Abstract: We reinvestigate the general distributed secure source coding based on the

proposed a framework of distributed source encryption and derived the necessary
and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission. However,
the bounds of the rate region, which specifies both necessary and sufficient
conditions to have reliable and secure transmission under the proposed
cryptosystem, were derived based on a self-tailored non-standard} security
criterion. In this paper we adopt the standard security criterion, i.e.,
standard mutual information. We successfully establish the bounds of the rate
region based on this security criterion. Information spectrum method and a
variant of Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem play an important role in deriving the
result.

Abstract: As the main issue in pinching-antenna system design, antenna location
optimization is key to realizing channel reconfigurability and system
flexibility. Most existing works in this area adopt sophisticated optimization
and learning tools to identify the optimal antenna locations in a numerical
manner, where insightful understandings of the pinching antenna placement are
still missing. Motivated by this research gap, this paper aims to carry out
analytical optimization for pinching antenna placement, where closed-form
solutions for the optimal antenna locations are obtained to reveal the impact
of antenna placement on the system performance. In particular, for the
user-fairness-oriented orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based transmission,
analytical results are obtained to reveal that the pinching antenna needs to be
activated at the place that would be beneficial to all served users; however,
the users' distances to the waveguide have no impact on the location selection.
For the greedy-allocation-based OMA transmission, an asymptotic study based on
a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation is carried out to show that the
optimal antenna location is in close proximity to the user who is nearest to
the waveguide. For non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission,
even with a user-fairness-oriented objective, the obtained analytical results
show that the optimal antenna location is not the position that can benefit all
users, but rather is near the user positioned closest to the waveguide.
