Critics seized upon\nthe findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack\ngenuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.\nMeanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning\nthe experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify\nthis debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most\ncontentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing\nincremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that\npreviously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result\nof output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs\nstill stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the\nRiver Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to\nhinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to\nsolvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100\nagent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs\nare stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely\nunderstand.

Different\nfrom the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic\ncoupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by\nre-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time\ninstant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of\nmultiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window\ndecoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed\ncodes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as\nsmall as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate\nthe performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially\ncoupled codes."}

We consider a brick-and-mortar retail\nsetting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive\nonline orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival\nof orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery\noffers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming\n(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network\n(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nintegrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost\nefficiency, with up to 6.7\\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and\napproximately 18\\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible\ndelivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces\noperational costs by 8\\% and 17\\%, respectively. These findings underscore the\nadvantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and\noffer practical guidance for urban logistics operators."}

Superposition coding (SC) and\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the\nintegrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed\nnavigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground\nusers or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application\nneeds, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have\nbeen developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors.\nWe then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA)\nand communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or\ncommunication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized\nposition dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The\neffectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by\nanalyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating\ncommunication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity."}

While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric\ncomplex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may\nnot be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not\nsupported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by\ninvestigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary\namplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's\nsignals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the\nachievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK\nmodulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first\nderive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results\nreveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase\nof MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We\nthen formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting\nthe phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive\nthe optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an\nimprovement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is\nbetter than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate,\nespecially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the\nbackscatter link in SBC."}

Deployed on building structures, ASTARS reflects\nnavigation signals to outdoor receivers in urban canyons and transmits signals\nindoors to bypass obstructions, providing high-precision positioning services\nto receivers in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. The path between ASTARS and the\nreceiver is defined as the extended line-of-sight (ELoS) path and an improved\ncarrier phase observation equation is derived to accommodate that. The receiver\ncompensates for its clock bias through network time synchronization, corrects\nthe actual signal path distance to the satellite-to-receiver distance through a\ndistance correction algorithm, and determines its position by using the least\nsquares (LS) method. Mathematical modeling of the errors introduced by the\nproposed method is conducted, followed by simulation analysis to assess their\nimpact. Simulation results show that: 1) in areas where GNSS signals are\nblocked, with time synchronization accuracy within a 10 ns error range, the\nproposed method provides positioning services with errors not exceeding 4 m for\nboth indoor and outdoor receivers, outperforming conventional NLoS methods with\npositioning errors of more than 7 m; 2) the additional errors introduced by the\nproposed method do not exceed 3 m for time synchronization errors within 10 ns,\nwhich includes the phase shift, beamwidth error, time synchronization errors,\nand satellite distribution errors, outperforming traditional NLoS methods,\nwhich typically produce positioning errors greater than 5 m."}

To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we\npropose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting\nmultiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an\nintent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of\nsemantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences.
