This enables\nexperimentation and examination of counterfactuals, simulating the consequences\nof decisions in real time. However, the DT accuracy relies on timely updates\nthat maintain alignment with the real system. We can distinguish between: (i)\npull-updates, which follow a request from the DT to the sensors, to decrease\nits drift from the physical state; (ii) push-updates, which are sent directly\nby the sensors since they represent urgent information, such as anomalies. In\nthis work, we devise a push-pull scheduler (PPS) medium access framework, which\ndynamically allocates the communication resources used for these two types of\nupdates. Our scheme strikes a balance in the trade-off between DT alignment in\nnormal conditions and anomaly reporting, optimizing resource usage and reducing\nthe drift age of incorrect information (AoII) by over 20% with respect to\nstate-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same anomaly detection\nguarantees, as well as reducing the worst-case anomaly detection AoII from 70\nms to 20 ms when considering a 1 ms average drift AoII constraint."}

By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts.

Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning.

LLM evaluation\nusing five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model\nstrengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency\nscores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By\nintegrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation\nand report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with\nprocess mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data\nscientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven\ninterpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in\ntranslating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights\nfor healthcare applications."}

These generalized landmarks are learned from a set\nof solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where\ntraditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized\nlandmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions\nthat are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all\nsimilar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we\nconstruct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark\nprogression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how\nto use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same\ndomain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a\nfew small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.\nIf a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant\nimprovement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks\ncapture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated\nplanner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the\nsame domain."}

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and\ncorrelate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the\nsearch space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby\naffecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible\nheuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original\nversion does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm\nthat requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time\nsolution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime\nversion that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually\nimproves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime\nRepairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*\nconcepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and\ncompleteness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.\nFurthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain\nand sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms."}

However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases\nshaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be\ninevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble\nDiagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that\norchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather\nthan collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that\nsuppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential\nstrengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician\nverification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large\nlanguage models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both\nconsensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty\nand latent biases transparent for clinical oversight.

Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,\nexperts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal\ngraph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal\nrelations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level\ndetails. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability\nof micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge\nencoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and\ncausally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our\nresults provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,\neven in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level.

However, standard gradient\nguidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward\nlandscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ninvolving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and\nmulti-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches\nrequire task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time\nflexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion\nPlanner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances\nexploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame\ntest-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:\n(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle\nguidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined\nthrough fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the\nlimitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and\nharnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only\npretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three\ndiverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze\nmulti-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on all tasks.

The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by\nanalyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,\nsimulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an\nassessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of\nspecialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a\nconsensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated\ndataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration\ndemonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart\nfailure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis.
