By extending the Hypatia\nframework, we record network path characteristics, e.g., delay and bandwidth,\nbetween two endpoints in the network during non-real-time simulations. Path\ncharacteristics are exported to Trace Files, which are replayed in real-time\nemulation environments on real systems, enabling evaluations with real software\nand human interaction. An advantage of our approach is its easy adaptability to\nexisting simulation models. Our extensive evaluation involves multiple\nscenarios with different satellite constellations, illustrating the approach's\naccuracy in reproducing the behavior of satellite networks. Between full\nsimulation, which serves as a baseline for our evaluation, and emulation runs,\nwe observe high correlation metrics of up to 0.96, validating the approach's\neffectiveness.

The corresponding results\ndepict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge\nof the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm\nprobability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although\nperfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker\nperspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward\nrelays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that\nleads to fast fading channels.

Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions."}

We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system.

We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL).
