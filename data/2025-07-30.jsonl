As a time-domain\ntechnique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given\nduration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time\ncan be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down\nmore radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably\nthe packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is\nallowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally\nbalance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic\nmaximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of\nservice (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for\ndifferent network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort\nto deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve\nit. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward\nfunction, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but\ndiscontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always\ntries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network\nand traffic conditions.

Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge.

We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group\nand individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial\noptimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain\ngraph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the\nindividual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset\nsettings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice\ncoefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that\nGDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible\nboundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting\nfunctional organization."}

More\nspecifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting\nAI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive\ndialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through\nuse cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,\nand policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions\ncan be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user\nexpertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal\nreasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader\nvision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health."}

To\naddress these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework\nenhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,\nwe propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:\n1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a\n\"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;\nand 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward\nproblem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present\nDecomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves\ngrounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into\nsmaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and\nScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference\nenhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best\nbaseline on ScreenSpot-Pro."}

However, their\nability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,\nevolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,\nwe introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in\nmulti-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users\nwho start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,\nrequiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with\ntools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a\nsignificant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For\ninstance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only\n20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer\nthan 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results\nhighlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task\nexecutors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive\nenvironment to measure and advance this critical capability."}

To bridge this gap, the 2025 Interspeech Speech Accessibility\nProject (SAP) Challenge was launched, utilizing over 400 hours of SAP data\ncollected and transcribed from more than 500 individuals with diverse speech\ndisabilities. Hosted on EvalAI and leveraging the remote evaluation pipeline,\nthe SAP Challenge evaluates submissions based on Word Error Rate and Semantic\nScore. Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2\nbaseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.\nNotably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\\%, and the highest\nSemScore of 88.44\\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR\nsystems in recognizing impaired speech."}

As a time-domain\ntechnique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given\nduration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time\ncan be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down\nmore radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably\nthe packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is\nallowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally\nbalance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic\nmaximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of\nservice (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for\ndifferent network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort\nto deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve\nit. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward\nfunction, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but\ndiscontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always\ntries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network\nand traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when\ncell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving\ndepending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than\n~1% QoS degradation."}
