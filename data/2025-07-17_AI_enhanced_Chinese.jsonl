However, whether such beam focusing can fully eliminate\ninterference under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI),\nrendering advanced interference management schemes unnecessary, remains an open\nquestion. To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our\ntransmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD)\narchitecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation. A\nminimum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the\nanalog beamfocuser, the digital beamfocuser, and the common rate allocation. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal\nanalog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational\ncomplexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital\nbeamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore\nthat: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even\nunder perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA\nunder imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture\ndelivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio\nfrequency chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RSMA\u548cHAD\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8e\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8eCSI\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1RSMA\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b50\u8fde\u63a5HAD\u67b6\u6784\u548cRSMA\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u60e9\u7f5a\u6027BCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u548c\u901f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\uff1bRSMA\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eSDMA\uff1bHAD\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce2\u675f\u805a\u7126\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cRSMA\u7ed3\u5408HAD\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work has examined IPv6 status as a binary: can\nyou use IPv6, or not? As deployment increases we must consider a more nuanced,\nnon-binary perspective on IPv6: how much and often can a user or a service use\nIPv6? We consider this question as a client, server, and cloud provider.\nConsidering the client's perspective, we observe user traffic. We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons. First, IPv6 traffic is primarily human-generated,\nthus showing diurnal patterns. Second, some services are IPv6-forward and\nothers IPv6-laggards, so as users do different things their fraction of IPv6\nvaries. We look at server-side IPv6 adoption in two ways. First, we expand\nanalysis of web services to examine how many are only partially IPv6 enabled\ndue to their reliance on IPv4-only resources. Our findings reveal that only\n12.5% of top 100k websites qualify as fully IPv6-ready. Finally, we examine\ncloud support for IPv6. Although all clouds and CDNs support IPv6, we find that\ntenant deployment rates vary significantly across providers. We find that ease\nof enabling IPv6 in the cloud is correlated with tenant IPv6 adoption rates,\nand recommend best practices for cloud providers to improve IPv6 adoption.

The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\n  In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSGV\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002MLLMs\u56e0\u5176\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-Grounded Verification (SGV)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SGV\u4f7fMLLMs\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd548%\u3002", "conclusion": "SGV\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations.

In particular, honeybees mainly\nuse the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their\nvisual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a\nReinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only\noptic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained\nagents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base\ntheir motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most\nattention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with\nlarge optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.
