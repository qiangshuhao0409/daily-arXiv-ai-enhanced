However, the use of high-radix electrical\nswitches to provide all-to-all connectivity in rails imposes massive power,\ncost, and complexity overheads.

Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly,\nresults from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected\nenablers have also been provided, which reinforce the efficacy of the KG method\nfor designing a sustainable 6G system."}

On the other hand, testing error\npatterns with a prescribed set of error patterns permuted by the ranking among\nmagnitudes of log-likelihood ratios (i.e., ordered reliability bits, ORB)\nenables efficient implementation, but results in performance loss for\nfinite-length codes. Aiming at harnessing the strengths of these two\napproaches, this work proposes a fine-tuning method to improve ORBGRAND,\nadjusting the ordering of tests with the aid of very few exact channel soft\nvalues.

However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated\napproaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including\nincreased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,\nsurrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization\nutilizing Gaussian process models have emerged."}

However, the current\nimplementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge\nretrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent\ninterpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN\n(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified\nNetwork Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.\nBy decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence\nlogic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for\nintelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge\ninterface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence\nagents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live\nnetwork knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation\nartifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future\nstandardization efforts."}

Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not\nnatively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G\nshall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support\nubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and\nstandardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and\nstandardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,\nwith a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and\ncapabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its\nthree essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization\ndirection; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable\nAI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The\nstandardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including\nan AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale\nfield trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered\nsignificant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause\nidentification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture\nand the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework\nfor 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation\nwith practical deployment."}
