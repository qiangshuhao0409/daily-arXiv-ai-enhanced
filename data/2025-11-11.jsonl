Reproducibility package with MLflow artifacts and Google Colab notebooks available upon publication", "summary": "LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked \"complete\" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale."}

PIR schemes have been extended to various scenarios with adversarial servers: PIR schemes where some servers are unresponsive or return noisy responses are called robust PIR and Byzantine PIR, respectively; PIR schemes where some servers collude to reveal the index are called colluding PIR. The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies. However, systematic ways to construct PIR schemes that achieve the upper bound are not known. In order to construct a capacity-achieving PIR schemes systematically, it is necessary to clarify the conditions that the queries should satisfy.

In this work, we consider a new challenge in which a set of nodes must transmit a set of shared messages to a central controller, without inter-node communication or retransmissions. Messages are distributed among random subsets of nodes, which must implicitly coordinate their transmissions over shared communication opportunities. The objective is to guarantee the delivery of all shared messages, regardless of which nodes transmit them. We first prove the optimality of deterministic strategies, and characterize the success rate degradation of a deterministic strategy under dynamic message-transmission patterns. To solve this problem, we propose a decentralized learning-based framework that enables nodes to autonomously synthesize deterministic transmission strategies aiming to maximize message delivery success, together with an online adaptation mechanism that maintains stable performance in dynamic scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability, demonstrating its robustness to varying network sizes and fast adaptation to dynamic changes in transmission patterns, outperforming existing multi-armed bandit approaches."}

This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint. We express the optimal constellation design as a system of nonlinear equations and establish the conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of its solution. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal modulation parameters using the generalized Lambert function, providing analytical insight into the system's behavior.

However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server.

In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems."}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs."}

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

These findings demonstrate that near-field beamfocusing is a robust and practically viable feature of RIS-assisted wireless communications."}

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively."}

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments."}

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best."}

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift."}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."}

Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs."}

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA).

We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications."}

Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks."}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software."}

To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements."}

EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \\cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}.

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning."}

We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios.

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems."}

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$)."}

We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks."}

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF."}

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series."}

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment."}

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies."}

Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies."}

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly."}

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking."}

We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations.
