This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

This research has been been initialised by an influential result of\nBarcel\\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded\nfragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of\naggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the\nquestion whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of\naggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite\nseveral attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving\nthat the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly\nexceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.\nBeyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical\ninsights on the expressive power of infinitary logics."}

We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation\nframework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and\nsolving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat\nevaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized\nto create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'\nweaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,\nopen-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and\nscalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable\ntasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited\nprogrammatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial\nreasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and\nscalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set\ncode-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible\nframework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking\nsystem, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can\nreliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are\ncapable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with\ntheir own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained\ncapability differences between models.
