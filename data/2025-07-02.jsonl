Given a set of\nrequests for deploying virtualized applications, the edge provider has to\ndeploy a maximum number of them to the underlying physical network, subject to\ncapacity constraints. This challenge is known as the virtual network embedding\n(VNE) problem: it models applications as virtual networks, where virtual nodes\nrepresent functions and virtual links represent communication between the\nvirtual nodes.\n  All variants of VNE are known to be strongly NP-hard. Because of its\ncentrality to network virtualization, VNE has been extensively studied. We\nfocus on the online variant of VNE, in which deployment requests are not known\nin advance. This reflects the highly skewed and unpredictable demand intrinsic\nto the edge. Unfortunately, existing solutions to online VNE do not scale well\nwith the number of requests per second and the physical topology size.\n  We propose a novel approach in which our new online algorithm, OLIVE,\nleverages a nearly optimal embedding for an aggregated expected demand. This\nembedding is computed offline. It serves as a plan that OLIVE uses as a guide\nfor handling actual individual requests while dynamically compensating for\ndeviations from the plan. We demonstrate that our solution can handle a number\nof requests per second greater by two orders of magnitude than the best results\nreported in the literature.

To mitigate the communication bottleneck in exchanging\nintermediate values, we propose new coded distributed computing schemes for the\nring-based network that exploit both ring topology and redundant computation\n(i.e., each map function is computed by $r$ nodes). Two typical cases are\nconsidered: all-gather where each node requires all intermediate values mapped\nfrom all input files, and all-to-all where each node requires a distinct set of\nintermediate values from other nodes. For the all-gather case, we propose a new\ncoded scheme based on successive reverse carpooling where nodes transmit every\nencoded packet containing two messages traveling in opposite directions along\nthe same path.

The importance of this\nproblem arises as such CT processes represent communications signals, and\nsampling must be applied to facilitate the DT processing associated with their\ncompression. Moreover, the physical characteristics of oscillators imply that\nthe sampling interval is incommensurate with the period of the autocorrelation\nfunction (AF) of the physical process, giving rise to the DT WSACS model\nconsidered. In addition, to reduce the loss, the sampling interval is generally\nshorter than the correlation length, and thus, the DT process is correlated as\nwell. The difficulty in the RDF characterization follows from the\ninformation-instability of WSACS processes, which renders the traditional\ninformation-theoretic tools inapplicable. In this work we utilize the\ninformation-spectrum framework to characterize the RDF when a finite and\nbounded delay is allowed between processing of subsequent source sequences.\nThis scenario extends our previous works which studied settings without\nprocessing delays or without memory. Numerical evaluations reveal the impact of\nscenario parameters on the RDF with asynchronous sampling."}

Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely\nreplicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This\npaper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision\nlogic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a\nReinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify\ncritical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes\nin the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the\noutput changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are\nthen trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate\nthe system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the\npipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,\nincluding threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.\nResults show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant\nboundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of\nthe underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating\nspecifications and test cases during legacy migration."}
