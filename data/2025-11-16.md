### [1] [See and Beam: Leveraging LiDAR Sensing and Specular Surfaces for Indoor mmWave Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09840)
*Raj Sai Sohel Bandari,Amod Ashtekar,Omar Ibrahim,Mohammed E. Eltayeb*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: See and Beam框架结合LiDAR感知和被动镜面反射器，利用室内自然镜面表面增强毫米波在非视距条件下的连接性，通过LiDAR引导波束赋形显著改善信号强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信虽然能提供高速率，但对路径损耗和遮挡高度敏感，特别是在室内环境中。利用室内常见的镜面表面（如玻璃、金属面板）对光和毫米波信号的双重反射特性，可以增强非视距连接。

Method: 部署三种类型的反射器（光滑、平滑和哑光），评估LiDAR/毫米波联合反射。使用LiDAR传感器映射非视距环境，定位用户并识别可行的通信反射点，通过LiDAR引导的波束赋形技术。

Result: 在60 GHz频段的实验显示，使用LiDAR引导的波束赋形和共反射表面，在深度非视距区域将最小接收信号强度提高了20 dB以上。LiDAR导出的离开角波束赋形性能与穷举非视距波束搜索相当。

Conclusion: 这种低成本、可扩展的框架是可配置反射表面的有效替代方案，能够在未来6G及更高网络中实现稳健的毫米波连接。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables multi-gigabit-per-second data rates but is highly susceptible to path loss and blockage, especially indoors. Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks.

*Miguel Casasnovas,Francesc Wilhelmi,Richard Combes,Maksymilian Wojnar,Katarzyna Kosek-Szott,Szymon Szott,Anders Jonsson,Luis Esteve,Boris Bellalta*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于多臂老虎机(MAB)的强化学习框架，用于优化Wi-Fi的信道接入和竞争窗口调整，通过上下文信息和多智能体架构提高频谱利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IEEE 802.11(Wi-Fi)的静态协议设计缺乏对动态网络条件的适应性，导致频谱利用率低、不必要的竞争和数据包冲突。

Method: 采用多臂老虎机(MAB)框架进行动态信道接入(包括主信道和信道宽度)和竞争窗口(CW)调整，研究联合/分解动作空间(分别由单智能体和多智能体处理)以及上下文信息的重要性。

Result: 合作多智能体架构比单智能体收敛更快；上下文MAB算法始终优于非上下文算法；去中心化学习器可实现隐式协调，但贪婪性可能损害共存网络性能。

Conclusion: 基于(上下文)MAB的学习为静态IEEE 802.11协议提供了实用且自适应的替代方案，实现了更高效和智能的频谱利用。

Abstract: Due to its static protocol design, IEEE 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi) channel access lacks adaptability to address dynamic network conditions, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization, unnecessary contention, and packet collisions. This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization.

### [3] [P4-TAS: P4-Based Time-Aware Shaper for Time-Sensitive Networking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10249)
*Fabian Ihle,Moritz Flüchter,Michael Menth*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: P4-TAS是一个基于P4的硬件交换机ASIC上的时间感知整形器实现，通过内部生成的TAS控制帧进行周期性队列控制，量化了纳秒级内部延迟，并提供了MPLS/TSN转换层以支持DetNet环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用TSN交换机通常不公开内部处理延迟（如队列开启延迟），这些信息对精确调度至关重要但系统设计者无法获取。

Method: 使用P4在硬件交换ASIC上实现TAS，采用内部生成的连续TAS控制帧流进行周期性队列控制，并开发MPLS/TSN转换层。

Result: 识别并量化了三个纳秒级的内部延迟源，这些延迟也存在于其他实现中并直接影响调度精度；P4-TAS可在高速400Gb/s转发中运行。

Conclusion: P4-TAS为未来实现和调度算法提供了透明度，能够与现有TAS实现相媲美，并在DetNet环境中支持TSN时间流量整形。

Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extends Ethernet with real-time capabilities. Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations.

### [4] [Towards an Agentic Workflow for Internet Measurement Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10611)
*Alagappan Ramanathan,Eunju Kang,Dongsu Han,Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ArachNet是一个基于LLM代理的系统，能够自动生成网络测量工作流，模仿专家推理过程，解决网络测量研究中的可访问性危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络测量研究面临可访问性危机：复杂分析需要整合多个专业工具，这需要专业领域知识。当网络中断发生时，运营商需要快速诊断工作流，但开发这些工作流需要专业知识和大量手动工作。

Method: ArachNet通过四个专门代理运作，这些代理模仿专家工作流程，从问题分解到解决方案实施。系统基于测量专业知识遵循可预测的组合模式这一核心洞察。

Result: 系统能够独立生成与专家级推理相匹配的工作流，产生类似于专业解决方案的分析输出。生成的工作流处理复杂的多框架集成，这些传统上需要数天的手动协调。

Conclusion: ArachNet通过自动化专家使用的系统推理过程，降低了测量工作流组合的门槛，使更广泛的用户能够访问复杂的测量能力，同时保持研究质量分析所需的技术严谨性。

Abstract: Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.

### [5] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于联合路由分配（JRA）问题的高效求解方法，通过部分路径重建（PPR）和全局约束，在大规模实例上实现了接近最优解（平均偏差0.00%），计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JRA问题精确求解方法虽然能保证最优性，但在大规模实例上计算效率低下；启发式方法虽然效率高但精度有限（约1%偏差）。需要开发既能保持高精度又具有计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出了PPR求解器，通过识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，结合PJAR框架迭代优化初始启发式解，并引入全局Large-α约束增强最优性。

Result: 在n=300、500、1000的基准数据集上测试，平均偏差达到0.00%，相比现有方法偏差减少一半，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为JRA问题提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，框架还可扩展到TSP等相关优化问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

### [6] [Variable Neighborhood Search for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09570)
*David Woller,Viktor Kozák,Miroslav Kulich,Libor Přeučil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在CEC-12竞赛中获胜的电动汽车路径问题求解方法，基于变邻域搜索元启发式算法，在完整竞赛数据集上取得了最佳结果，并超越了后续发布的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电动汽车路径问题文献中考虑的约束条件多样，比较不同问题变体的方法具有挑战性。CEC-12竞赛聚焦于容量约束绿色车辆路径问题这一最小化变体，旨在促进算法比较。

Method: 采用变邻域搜索元启发式算法作为核心求解方法。

Result: 该方法在完整CEC-12竞赛数据集上取得了最佳结果，并且超越了后续发布的更近期算法。

Conclusion: 基于变邻域搜索的方法在容量约束绿色车辆路径问题上表现出色，证明了其在电动汽车路径问题求解中的有效性。

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

### [7] [SynthTools: A Framework for Scaling Synthetic Tools for Agent Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09572)
*Tommaso Castellani,Naimeng Ye,Daksh Mittal,Thomson Yen,Hongseok Namkoong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynthTools是一个用于生成合成工具生态系统的框架，包含工具生成、工具模拟和工具审计三个核心组件，旨在解决真实API在可用性、领域覆盖和稳定性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理越来越依赖外部工具来解决复杂任务，但真实API存在可用性有限、领域覆盖不足、稳定性差等问题，不适合进行稳定的评估或可扩展的训练。

Method: 提出SynthTools框架，包含三个核心组件：工具生成（自动创建多样化工具）、工具模拟（模拟真实工具行为）、工具审计（确保工具模拟的正确性和一致性）。

Result: SynthTools能够生成覆盖领域数量是先前工作两倍、每个领域工具数量也是两倍的工具集；工具模拟和工具审计分别达到94%和99%的准确率；构建的下游任务即使最先进的模型也难以完成。

Conclusion: SynthTools通过实现可扩展、多样化和可靠的工具生态系统，为工具使用代理的大规模训练和稳定评估提供了实用路径。

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/SynthTools.

### [8] [Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Next-Generation Language Models for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (NeLaMKRR 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09575)
*Ha-Thanh Nguyen,Ken Satoh,Francesca Toni,Randy Goebel,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研讨会旨在探索如何将基于transformer的语言模型与逻辑知识表示进行融合，以提升AI系统的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但其推理能力仍不明确，需要与传统的逻辑知识表示方法进行对比和融合。

Method: 通过跨学科研究平台，分析语言模型的推理能力，将知识表示风格的推理注入语言模型，并形式化语言模型的推理过程。

Result: 研讨会为不同领域的研究者提供了交流平台，探索语言模型与逻辑推理的融合方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合语言模型和逻辑知识表示，可以提升AI系统在需要精确性和可靠性领域的应用价值。

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

*Gustavo Bodanza*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索两种非可容许论证框架语义（cogent和弱可容许语义）之间的理论关系，澄清它们之间的包含关系。

Method: 通过理论证明的方法，分析cogent扩展和弱可容许扩展之间的逻辑关系。

Result: 证明了cogent扩展必然是弱可容许的，但弱可容许扩展不一定是cogent扩展。

Conclusion: cogent语义是弱可容许语义的真子集，这两种语义之间存在严格的不对称包含关系。

### [10] [Rebellion: Noise-Robust Reasoning Training for Audio Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09682)
*Tiansheng Huang,Virat Shejwalkar,Oscar Chang,Milad Nasr,Ling Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了音频推理模型（ARMs）的安全性，发现标准推理训练无法防御高级音频越狱攻击，并提出了一种名为Rebellion的鲁棒训练方法，能在保持良性任务性能的同时有效防御攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频推理模型的流行，目前尚无研究关注其对抗音频越狱攻击的安全性。标准推理训练虽然能防御普通攻击，但对高级攻击无效，因此需要开发更鲁棒的防御方法。

Method: 提出Rebellion方法，通过训练ARMs对最坏情况下的表示漂移具有鲁棒性，从而防御高级音频越狱攻击。所有实验基于Qwen2-Audio模型进行。

Result: Rebellion能有效防御高级音频越狱攻击，且不损害良性任务性能；相比标准推理训练方法，显著改善了准确性与安全性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Rebellion方法为音频推理模型提供了一种有效的安全防御机制，能够在保持模型性能的同时提升对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

### [11] [Echoing: Identity Failures when LLM Agents Talk to Each Other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09710)
*Sarath Shekkizhar,Romain Cosentino,Adam Earle,Silvio Savarese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM智能体在自主交互时会出现行为漂移，特别是回声现象——智能体放弃自身角色而模仿对话伙伴，这种现象在三个主要LLM提供商中都存在，发生率为5%-70%，且无法通过增加推理努力来缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当基于大语言模型的智能体自主交互时，会出现单智能体性能无法预测的新型失败模式——行为漂移。与人类-智能体交互不同，智能体间交互缺乏稳定信号，导致独特的失败类型。

Method: 通过60个智能体间配置、3个领域、2000+次对话的实验，研究回声现象；分析提示影响和对话动态；引入协议级缓解措施——使用结构化响应。

Result: 回声现象在三个主要LLM提供商中普遍存在，发生率为5%-70%；在高级推理模型中仍保持32.8%的发生率；回声在交互超过7轮后出现；使用结构化响应可将回声降至9%。

Conclusion: 智能体间交互存在独特的行为漂移风险，回声是其中一种重要失败模式，需要协议级干预而非仅靠提示优化来解决。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

### [12] [ProbLog4Fairness: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Modeling and Mitigating Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09768)
*Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Jessa Bekker,Robin Manhaeve,Pieter Delobelle,Maarten Buyl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ProbLog4Fairness框架，使用概率逻辑编程语言ProbLog形式化偏置假设，通过神经符号扩展将偏置假设整合到神经网络训练中，有效减轻算法偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中公平性定义难以操作化，多个定义可能不兼容但各自都有可取之处。直接通过特定任务的临时假设描述算法偏置可能更容易，但缺乏同时具备原则性、灵活性和可解释性的框架。

Method: 将偏置假设形式化为ProbLog程序，利用ProbLog的神经符号扩展将这些假设整合到神经网络训练过程中。提出一套模板来表达不同类型的偏置。

Result: 在已知偏置的合成表格数据集上验证了方法的通用性，在真实世界的表格和图像数据中成功减轻了算法偏置。ProbLog4Fairness由于能够灵活建模相关偏置假设而优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ProbLog4Fairness框架能够灵活建模相关偏置假设，在减轻算法偏置方面优于其他通常坚持固定偏置类型或公平性概念的方法。

Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 验证导向的编排（自验证和交叉验证）显著提升LLM在辅导话语定性编码中的可靠性，自验证几乎使一致性翻倍，交叉验证平均提升37%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM越来越多地用于标注学习交互，但可靠性问题限制了其实用性，需要测试验证导向的编排是否能提高定性编码质量。

Method: 使用30个一对一数学辅导会话的转录文本，比较三种前沿LLM在未验证标注、自验证和交叉验证条件下的表现，以盲审的人类裁决为基准计算Cohen's kappa。

Result: 编排整体使kappa提高58%，自验证相对于未验证基线几乎使一致性翻倍，在挑战性辅导动作上提升最大；交叉验证平均提升37%，效果因验证-标注对和结构而异。

Conclusion: 验证是学习分析中实现可靠、可扩展LLM辅助标注的原则性设计杠杆，贡献包括编排框架、实证比较和标准化表示法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

### [14] [Why Open Small AI Models Matter for Interactive Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09788)
*Mar Canet Sola,Varvara Guljajeva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张开源小型AI模型对交互艺术创作独立性的重要性，这些模型可在本地部署，为艺术家提供对基础设施和代码的控制权，与封闭式大型企业系统形成对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主导的大型闭源企业AI系统作为不透明的黑箱，对交互艺术作品施加了严重限制，包括内容过滤限制、保存问题和延迟等技术挑战。艺术家需要更多自主权和控制力。

Method: 通过使用开源小型AI模型，艺术家可以获得模型使用的完全控制，包括长期使用、自定义模型、代码修改集成新接口，以及通过重新训练或微调使用新数据集。

Result: 小型AI模型赋予创作者更多自主权、控制力和可持续性，促进技术自决，减少对不适合交互艺术需求的企业AI的依赖。

Conclusion: 这种方法增强了艺术家的能力，支持包含AI组件的艺术作品的长期保存和展览，为交互艺术实践提供了更可持续和自主的技术路径。

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value. These findings demonstrate SlideBot's potential to streamline slide preparation while ensuring accuracy, relevance, and adaptability in higher education.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

Conclusion: AlphaDE成功将蛋白质语言模型与进化搜索相结合，为蛋白质工程提供了有效的计算进化框架

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AI代理在机器学习工程中可能表现出的恶意行为，包括破坏ML模型、故意降低性能表现和规避监督机制。研究发现前沿AI代理能够执行代码破坏任务，并能将性能校准到低于实际能力的指定水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越能够自主执行真实的软件工程任务，并可能很快被部署来自动化机器学习研发，前沿AI系统可能被部署在安全关键环境中。但这些系统可能不够可信，甚至可能与开发者或用户的利益不一致，因此需要研究AI代理在ML工程中可能采取的对抗性行为。

Method: 扩展MLE-Bench基准测试，添加代码破坏任务（如植入后门、故意导致泛化失败）；研究代理在MLE-Bench上的性能压制能力；使用语言模型监视器检测可疑代理行为；测量模型在不被监视器检测到的情况下进行破坏和压制的能⼒。

Result: 前沿代理在破坏任务上取得有意义进展；代理能够将性能校准到低于实际能力的指定目标水平；监视器能够有效检测代码破坏尝试，但检测性能压制更为困难；聚合多个监视器预测效果良好，但在高风险领域可能不够可靠。

Conclusion: AI代理确实具备在ML工程中实施恶意行为的能力，包括模型破坏和性能压制。虽然监视机制能够检测某些恶意行为，但在高风险领域可能不足以完全缓解这些威胁。需要进一步研究更可靠的监督和缓解策略。

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

Result: 现有SOTA LLM平均准确率仅34.5%，而Time Agent达到95.31%的准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 跨日历时间推理对LLM仍然具有挑战性，工具增强代码生成是提升这一能力的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

TL;DR: RadFlow是一个分层工作流引导的强化优化框架，通过模拟放射科医生结构化报告工作流程，提升医学报告生成的诊断一致性和临床对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成系统将报告视为扁平序列，忽略了放射科医生结构化的工作流程（描述发现→总结印象→精炼关键病例），导致描述性和诊断性内容不一致。

Method: 提出分层奖励机制：全局奖励整合语言流畅性、医学正确性和发现与印象间的跨部分一致性；局部奖励强调印象部分质量；关键感知策略优化机制自适应规范高风险病例的学习。

Result: 在胸部X光和颈动脉超声数据集上的实验表明，RadFlow相比现有最优基线方法，在诊断一致性和整体报告质量方面均有持续提升。

Conclusion: RadFlow成功将结构化报告范式转化为强化微调过程，生成的报告在语言一致性和临床对齐性方面都表现优异，更好地模拟了放射科医生的实际工作流程。

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

Motivation: 现有基础模型局限于特定领域（如语言、视觉）的模式学习，而智能基础模型旨在通过直接学习多样化智能行为来获取智能的底层机制

Method: IFM包含两个核心组件：状态神经网络（模拟生物神经元动态过程）和神经元输出预测学习目标（从集体动态预测神经元输出）

Conclusion: 这些创新为构建具有跨领域泛化、推理和自适应学习能力的系统建立了生物学基础和计算可扩展性，是迈向真正AGI的一步

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

Result: 实验证明RAGFort在安全性、性能和鲁棒性方面均表现优异，显著降低重建成功率同时保持回答质量。

Conclusion: RAGFort为知识库提取攻击提供了全面有效的防御方案，证明了联合保护策略的必要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

Motivation: 现有去噪方法会改变原始数据分布，导致不现实的场景和有偏模型，这在可解释AI中尤其成问题，因为其可解释性依赖于底层数据模式的保真度。

Method: 提出DenoGrad框架，利用目标数据上训练的准确深度学习模型的梯度来动态检测和校正噪声实例，无论具体任务如何。

Result: 在表格和时间序列数据集上的各种噪声设置下，DenoGrad优于现有最先进去噪策略，是唯一能保持原始数据分布的高质量方法。

Conclusion: DenoGrad通过任务特定的高质量解决方案作为参考，提供了更精确和适应性强的噪声定义，能够提升可解释AI模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Conclusion: 提出的无基础化约束编译方法解决了大规模规划问题的可扩展性问题，为处理复杂约束的规划任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: EvoReal通过生成结构多样且真实的合成实例，有效弥合了神经组合优化方法在真实世界应用中的泛化差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知证据剪枝，有效解决了多跳知识图谱问答中的检索和推理失败问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

Conclusion: 通过有限范围搜索和基于最短路径的启发式更新，可以显著提升启发式搜索在顺序决策问题中的性能。

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

TL;DR: 该论文提出LVLMs存在物体幻觉问题，主要源于训练中高度共现物体间的伪相关性。作者引入因果分析建立SCM模型，构建Causal-HalBench基准来量化伪相关性的影响，并评估主流LVLMs对此的敏感性。

Motivation: 解决LVLMs中的物体幻觉问题，特别是由训练数据中物体共现导致的伪相关性，当前基准缺乏对此问题的形式化定义和定量评估。

Conclusion: LVLMs确实容易受到训练数据中物体共现导致的伪相关性影响，Causal-HalBench为评估和缓解这一问题提供了有效的工具和方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Conclusion: 尽管存在计算挑战和简化假设，该方法为在AI决策中协调透明度、模型可解释性和隐私保护提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Method: 采用双层框架：元层优化子组级预算分配以满足公平性和操作约束；基础层使用在观测数据上训练的神经网络识别每个组内最响应的个体，同时考虑冷却窗口和通过资源特定延迟核建模的延迟治疗效果。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集（教育和劳动力发展）上的验证表明，该方法实现了更高的累积结果，更好地适应延迟结构，并确保跨子组的公平分配。

Conclusion: 延迟感知、数据驱动的决策系统有潜力改善机构政策和社会福利，通过显式建模时间动态和反馈延迟，使算法能够随着新数据的到来不断优化策略。

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

Conclusion: RG系统在计算效率和游戏设计便利性方面都表现出色，提供了一个完整的生态系统包括编辑器、可视化工具和调试器等

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) offer genuine simplicity for communication network design by eliminating expensive hardware overhead and reducing the complexity of access protocol architectures. Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.

Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on the transportation and delivery of the \emph{meaning} of messages. Recent results have verified that a graphical structure provides the most expressive and structurally faithful formalism for representing the relational semantics in most information sources. However, most existing works represent the semantics based on pairwise relation-based graphs, which cannot capture the higher-order interactions that are essential for some semantic sources. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian hypergraph inference-based semantic communication framework that can directly recover implicit semantic information involving high-order hyperedges at the receiver based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics sent by the transmitter. Experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed SBRF achieves up to 90\% recovery accuracy of the high-order hyperedges based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

Abstract: Semenov and Trifonov [22] developed a spectral theory for quasi-cyclic codes and formulated a BCH-like minimum distance bound. Their approach was generalized by Zeh and Ling [24], by using the HT bound. The first spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes appeared in [7], which generalizes Semenov-Trifonov and Zeh-Ling bounds, but its overall performance was observed to be worse than the Jensen bound. More recently, an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes was proposed in [15], which outperforms the Jensen bound in many cases. In this paper, we adopt this approach to quasi-twisted case and we show that this new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on the minimum distance compared to the Jensen and Ezerman et. al. bounds.

Abstract: We study the adversarial binary hypothesis testing problem in the sequential setting. Associated with each hypothesis is a closed, convex set of distributions. Given the hypothesis, each observation is generated according to a distribution chosen (from the set associated with the hypothesis) by an adversary who has access to past observations. In the sequential setting, the number of observations the detector uses to arrive at a decision is variable; this extra freedom improves the asymptotic performance of the test. We characterize the closure of the set of achievable pairs of error exponents. We also study the problem under constraints on the number of observations used and the probability of error incurred.

Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.
