In this paper, we investigate holographic beamforming designs for\nISAC systems, which, unlike existing holographic beamforming schemes developed\nfor RHS-aided communications, requires explicit consideration of mutual\ncoupling effects within RHS. This is because, different from prior works only\nconsidering communication performance, ISAC systems incorporate sensing\nfunctionality, which is sensitive to sidelobe levels. Ignoring mutual coupling\nin holographic beamforming can lead to notable undesired sidelobes, thus\ndegrading sensing performance. The consideration of mutual coupling introduces\nnew challenges, i.e., it induces non-linearity in beamforming problems,\nrendering them inherently non-convex. To address this issue, we propose a\ntractable electromagnetic-compliant holographic ISAC model that characterizes\nmutual coupling in a closed form using coupled dipole approximations.

However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a\nspectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in\nmultiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral\ndetails and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.\nExtensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\\text{dB}$\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based\nmethod.

Given the infeasibility of finding optimal\nsolutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and\nuncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed\nlearning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK\nenables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions,\nensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and\nresilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead\nand computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global\nscale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For\n25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop\nrate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to\nDijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99%\nrelative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while\nachieving up to 46% higher throughput. At the same time, SKYLINK maintains\nconstant computational complexity with respect to constellation size."}

The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver\npresents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low\npower, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However,\nthe ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one\ninitiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead\nto significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the\ntransceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework\neffectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for\nenergy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that\nsignificantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise\nranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized\nwake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to\nremain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy\nminimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost\noscillators. To validate the framework, we designed and developed custom nodes\nthat are compliant with the framework's protocol. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed approach allows a node to stay in ultra-low power mode and\nwake periodically to check for instructions. The node can remain in standby\nmode for up to nine months on a single coin cell battery and can perform\nranging operations on demand in near real-time, all while maintaining a\nlocalization accuracy within five meters."}

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align\nwith the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and\nhallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating\nfurther alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nThought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied\ndecision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based\noptimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step\nsample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning\nprocess, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by\nincorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes\nconsistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld\nenvironment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%\nimprovement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in\nmitigating model degradation after fine-tuning.

By observing how\nLLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only\npossible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges\ndisagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be\n100\\% correct in their judgments.

To address this critical gap, we introduce the\nfirst failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity\ncausal inference.

The framework's\nattribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating\ntargeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual\nsimulations.
