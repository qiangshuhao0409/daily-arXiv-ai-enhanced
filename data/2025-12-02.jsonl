While traditional connectivity providers have built trust over decades through widespread adoption, established practices, and regulation, entities in a decentralized wireless network, lacking this foundation, may be incentivized to exploit the service for their own advantage. For example, a dishonest hotspot operator can intentionally violate the agreed upon connection terms in an attempt to increase their profits. In this paper, we examine and develop a taxonomy of adversarial behavior patterns in decentralized wireless networks. Our case study finds that provider-driven attacks can potentially more than triple provider earnings. We conclude the paper with a discussion on the critical need to develop novel techniques to detect and mitigate adversarial behavior in decentralized wireless networks."}

In a typical multi-server FL architecture, the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. Under this architecture, clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this observation, we propose a cloud-free multi-server FL framework that leverages Overlapping Clients (OCs) as relays for inter-server model exchange while uploading the local updated model to ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs without introducing new communication links. We derive a new convergence upper bound for non-convex objectives under non-IID data and an arbitrary number of cells, which explicitly quantifies the impact of inter-server propagation depth on convergence error. Guided by this theoretical result, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize dissemination range of each ES model among all ESs within a limited latency. To solve this problem, we develop a conflict-graph-based local search algorithm optimizing the routing strategy and scheduling the transmission times of individual ESs to its neighboring ESs. This enables ES models to be relayed across multiple hops through neighboring ESs by OCs, achieving the widest possible transmission coverage for each model without introducing new communication links. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods."}

A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices."}

Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparam- eters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search. These results establish R-BO as an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments."}

Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies an equalized odds, that is, such that $I(Y;S|T) =0$. In contrast to our previous work, we assume here that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. Furthermore, we impose a geometric structure on the conditional distribution $P_{S|Y}$, allowing $Y$ and $S$ to have a small correlation, bounded by a threshold. When the threshold is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to approximate mutual information and reformulate the fair mechanism design problem as a quadratic program with closed-form solutions under certain constraints. For other cases, we derive simple, low-complexity lower bounds based on the maximum singular value and vector of a matrix. Finally, we compare our designs with the optimal solution in a numerical example."}

These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a \"what-if\" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes."}

A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B.

Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation."}

Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier."}

However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves."}

In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations.

With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing."}

Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to \"hallucinated\" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B.

However, full-digital architectures have prohibitive hardware costs, making hybrid analog-digital (HAD) designs the primary alternative. Nevertheless, such architectures compromise beamfocusing precision and lead to energy leakage, which exacerbates inter-user interference and increases eavesdropping risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enhanced secure transmit scheme for near-field ISAC. For the first time, it exploits the common stream in RSMA to concurrently (i) flexibly manage interference, (ii) act as artificial noise to suppress eavesdropping, and (iii) serve as sensing sequences. The objective is to maximize the minimum secrecy rate while satisfying the angle and distance Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints. This results in a hard, non-convex optimization problem, and we employ block coordinate descent to decompose it into three sub-problems with lower computational complexity. In the first stage of optimizing fully digital beamfocusers, we develop an iterative solution using weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE), quadratic transform, and Taylor expansion methods, thus avoiding conventional semidefinite relaxation. In the second and third stages, the analog and digital beamfocusers are optimized in closed form. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme (1) achieves near full-digital beamfocusing performance with a 16-fold reduction in RF chains, (2) provides superior secrecy performance compared to conventional beamfocusing-only and far-field security schemes, and (3) enables high-accuracy sensing with negligible loss in secrecy performance."}

This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies."}

These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, nonlinear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state-action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-ReaVI, to solve this problem. We reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) the optimal routing policy is a monotonic handover policy that adapts to the availability of routes and their mean delays; and (ii) the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy, with at most \"N choose 2 + N\" breakpoints given N routes. Numerical experiments in a satellite-terrestrial integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance, or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI."}

Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o."}

Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier."}

Through a series of experiments on data from Columbia University Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center, and MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that patterns of missingness significantly impact zero-shot predictive performance. Notably, the explicit inclusion of missingness indicators at prompting benefits some while hurting other LLMs' zero-shot predictive performance and calibration, suggesting an inconsistent impact. The proposed aggregated analysis and theoretical insights suggest that larger models benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted. The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of missingness, often neglected even in conventional ML, even further. We conclude that there is a need for more transparent accounting and systematic evaluation of the impact of representing (informative) missingness on downstream performance."}

These protocols must coexist within the same frequency bands, leading to mutual interference. This paper investigates the physical-layer impact of two types of narrowband signals (BPSK and GMSK) on LoRa demodulation. We employ symbol-level Monte Carlo simulations to analyse how the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) affects the symbol error rate (SER) at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise floor, and then compare the results with those for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of equal power. We demonstrate that modelling narrowband interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) systematically overestimates the SER of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) demodulation. We also clarify the distinct impairment levels induced by AWGN and two types of narrowband interferers, and provide physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we fit a two-segment function for the maximum INR that ensures correct demodulation across SNRs, with one segment for low SNR and the other for high SNR."}

In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $α$ and the variable selection ratio $ρ$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = αN$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = ρN$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $ρN$ dimensions can separate $αN$ random patterns if and only if $α< 2ρ$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings."}

However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains."}

Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular.

We propose EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination), an inference-time criterion that adaptively stops denoising once sufficient reasoning stability relative to training-time reasoning is detected. EDIT monitors the alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). During training, optimization dynamics generate rich metadata about parameter importance that in prior methods is typically discarded upon model release. We preserve this information as a compact representation of learned reasoning pathways. During inference, alignment scores are converted to a distribution over the tokens already unmasked at the current denoising step, and convergence is detected when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below a threshold on the matched unmasked (visible) tokens. Across reasoning benchmarks, EDIT reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% while preserving or improving accuracy in most settings, with approximately 0.02% storage overhead (about 1.5-2 MB for all QKV modules across 32 blocks in an 8 GB model).

This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization.

This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks."}

We dissect the inherent human intention model and the preference flipping mechanism introduced by external factors as two distinct stages; in the latter, we introduce an instance-dependent flipping probability on the basis of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model.

Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning."}

Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier."}

Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability."}

Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces."}

However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates."}

Experiments on LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b reveal that masking only a tiny portion of the language model's feed-forward networks (just as few as four neurons in extreme cases) suffices to trigger catastrophic collapse.

These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a \"what-if\" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes."}

This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world scenarios.Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains."}

A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition."}

We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \\textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \\textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized."}

Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition.

I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control."}

As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model.\n  We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \\textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \\textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures.

Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings.

Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity. Our results demonstrate that combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools."}

However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment.

While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned."}

Existing solutions typically rely on specialized profile-merging procedures within a label-correcting framework that results in searching over complex profiles. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search, which employs a novel profile dominance rule to avoid generating and handling complex profiles. We develop four variants of our method and evaluate them on real-world road networks enriched with realistic energy consumption data.

We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.\n  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.\n  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis."}

Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis."}

In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process.

To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines.

Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors.

In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios."}

Code and data will be available at https://github.com/sitaocheng/from_atomic_to_composite", "summary": "The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks."}

Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training."}

We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games."}

Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparam- eters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search. These results establish R-BO as an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments."}

A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics."}

Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation."}

In these contexts, the ability to predict changes in wireless channel quality can enable adaptive strategies and significantly improve system robustness. This contribution focuses on the prediction of the Frame Delivery Ratio (FDR), a key metric that represents the percentage of successful transmissions, starting from time sequences of binary outcomes (success/failure) collected in a real scenario. The analysis focuses on two models of deep learning: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), both selected for their ability to predict the outcome of time sequences. Models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity, with the aim of evaluating their applicability to systems with limited resources. Preliminary results show that both models are able to predict the evolution of the FDR with good accuracy, even from minimal information (a single binary sequence). In particular, CNN shows a significantly lower inference latency, with a marginal loss in accuracy compared to LSTM."}

Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems."}
