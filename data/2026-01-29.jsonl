Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention."}

This paper provides a comprehensive framework for dependable IWCNs, bridging theory and practice. We first establish the theoretical foundations of dependability, including outlining its key attributes and presenting analytical tools to study it. Next, we explore practical enablers, such as adaptive multiple access schemes leveraging real-time monitoring and time-sensitive networking to ensure end-to-end determinism.

Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $γ$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $γ\\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $Θ(γ)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log γ)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $γ$."}

In this regard, we propose a dynamic scheme for joint antenna and power adaptation to improve NES from a user scheduling and resource allocation perspective. Antenna adaptation is performed using the multiple channel state information resource signal (CSI-RS) framework. Furthermore, the recently introduced transmit power-aware link adaptation scheme, referred to as POLITE for short, is used as the power adaptation technique. The proposed scheme adapts to variations in users' instantaneous traffic and channel conditions to opportunistically maximize NES while also inherently accounting for the user throughput. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme consistently achieves a balance between NES and user perceived throughput (UPT) for different network load conditions.

We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG.

LCD codes have a trivial hull so they are counterparts of self-orthogonal codes. So it is a natural question whether one can embed linear codes into optimal LCD codes. To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes.

In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver."}

Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines."}

We explain the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon through a concise mathematical argument. This observation has direct implications for estimating random propagation effects such as fading, particularly when reflections off walls are involved.\n  Motivated by understanding intelligent surfaces, we apply this fundamental result to a physical model consisting of a single transmitter between two parallel passive walls. We analyze signal fading due to reflections and observe power oscillations resulting from wall reflections -- a phenomenon long studied in waveguides but relatively unexplored in wireless networks. For the special case where the transmitter is placed halfway between the walls, we present a compact closed-form expression for the received signal involving the Lerch transcendent function.

However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE."}

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency."}

This paper provides a comprehensive framework for dependable IWCNs, bridging theory and practice. We first establish the theoretical foundations of dependability, including outlining its key attributes and presenting analytical tools to study it. Next, we explore practical enablers, such as adaptive multiple access schemes leveraging real-time monitoring and time-sensitive networking to ensure end-to-end determinism.

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl.

Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \\textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation.

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making."}

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes."}

Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts."}

Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.\n  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies."}

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area."}

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence."}

We evaluate with training two types of μ, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on μ-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that μ-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets.
