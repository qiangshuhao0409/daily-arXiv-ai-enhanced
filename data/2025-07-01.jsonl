Here, we propose the opposite, where\nwe exploit the sensing capabilities of the receiver for communication. Our goal\nis to characterize the fundamental limits of communication over such a channel,\nwhich we call `$\\textit{communication via sensing}$'. We assume that changes in\nthe sensed attributes, e.g., location, speed, etc., are limited due to\npractical constraints, which are captured by assuming a finite-state channel\n(FSC) with an input cost constraint. We first formulate an upper bound on the\n$N$-letter capacity as a cost-constrained optimization problem over the input\nsequence distribution, and then convert it to an equivalent problem over the\nstate sequence distribution. Moreover, by breaking a walk on the underlying\nMarkov chain into a weighted sum of traversed graph cycles in the long walk\nlimit, we obtain a compact single-letter formulation of the capacity upper\nbound. Finally, for a specific case of a two-state FSC with noisy sensing\ncharacterized by a binary symmetric channel (BSC), we obtain a closed-form\nexpression for the capacity upper bound. Comparison with an existing numerical\nlower bound shows that our proposed upper bound is very tight for all crossover\nprobabilities."}

The\ncomplexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead\nto a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or\nunderstanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and\nguidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools\naimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI.

This paper\nintroduces two families of linear channel codes to mitigate ISI: Zero Pad Zero\nStart (ZPZS) and Zero Pad (ZP) codes, ensuring that each codeword avoids\nconsecutive bit-1s. The ZPZS and ZP codes are then combined to form a binary ZP\ncode, offering a higher code rate than linear ZP codes and allowing simple\ndecoding via the Majority Location Rule (MLR). Additionally, a Leading One Zero\nPad (LOZP) code is proposed, which relaxes zero-padding constraints by\nprioritizing the placement of bit-1s, achieving a higher rate than ZP. A\nclosed-form expression is derived to compute expected ISI, showing it depends\non the average bit-1 density in the codewords. ISI and Bit Error Rate (BER)\nperformance are evaluated under two MCvD channel models: (i) without refresh,\nwhere past bits persist longer, and (ii) with refresh, where the channel is\ncleared after each reception. Results show that the LOZP code performs better\nin the refresh channel due to initial bit-1 placement, while ZP excels without\nrefresh by reducing average bit-1 density.

To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\n\\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this\nstrategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its\nincident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most\npertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is\neffectively fused with the central node's own representation using a\n\\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused\nnode message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and\nfeatures of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures\nand propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link\nprediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant\ninformation.

Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math\nand science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it\nis well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and\nconsistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these\nsystems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general\nintelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound\nbehavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their\ndevelopment. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive\nreasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift\nfrom optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning\nproblems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning\nparadigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning\nis both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide\nalgorithm design."}

Nevertheless, the existing\nbenchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision\nalgorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we\nhave devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we\nestablished the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of\nnon-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence\nrelationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel\nperspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further\nintroduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the\nHistory Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the\nstate dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series.

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement.
