In particular, significant load balancing\nchallenges arise when processing AI/ML workloads, consisting of low-entropy,\nbursty and long-lived flows. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as\nEqual-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) struggle to maintain high network utilization.\nWhile major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of\nacademia have proposed packet spraying to enhance AI/ML workload performance,\nwe argue that existing packet spraying solutions lead to buffer inflation over\ntime, negatively affecting network performance. Specifically, when ACK\ncoalescing is used, these solutions lead to stale information, degrading\nnetwork performance. Additionally, in asymmetric network conditions- such as\nmix of ordered an unordered traffic, or link degradation and failures- existing\npacket spraying solutions often lead to increased tail latency. In this paper,\nwe present the design and evaluation of PRIME, a pseudo-randomized round-robin\napproach to packet spraying that considers the network topology to optimize\nload distribution and performance. PRIME uses congestion as an indicator to\nre-balance the load. To this extent, PRIME takes into account various\ncongestion signals, accounting for congestion severity, and their decay times\nto avoid network hotspots.

For enhanced coverage, the\npayload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to\nmaintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to\nachieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak\ndetection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint\ndespreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while\nmaintaining simplicity in implementation.

In this paper, we prove that there\nexists a class of near-optimal UCIs, called $\\nu$ code, to achieve\n$K_\\nu=2.0386$. This narrows the range of the minimum expansion factor for\noptimal UCI to $2\\leq C_{\\mathcal{C}}^{*}\\leq 2.0386$. Another new class of\nUCI, called $\\Delta\\delta$ code, is specifically constructed. We show that the\n$\\Delta\\delta$ code and $\\nu$ code are currently optimal in terms of minimum\nexpansion factor. In addition, we propose a new proof that shows the minimum\nexpansion factor of the optimal UCI is lower bounded by $2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u03bd\u7801\u7684\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7f16\u7801\uff08UCI\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u7f29\u5c0f\u52302\u2264C_C\u2217\u22642.0386\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u0394\u03b4\u7801\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u03bd\u7801\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u7528\u6574\u6570\u7f16\u7801\uff08UCI\uff09\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u03bd\u7801\u548c\u0394\u03b4\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u7f29\u5c0f\u52302\u2264C_C\u2217\u22642.0386\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u03bd\u7801\u548c\u0394\u03b4\u7801\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684UCI\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03bd\u7801\u548c\u0394\u03b4\u7801\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3aUCI\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

These results\nexpose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,\nparticularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual\nadaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap\nbut also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that\ncurrent architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene\nanalysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters\nthat humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.\nThis work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward\nhuman-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches\nintegrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and\ncontext-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f7b\u677e\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u8d85\u8fc793%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5728\u590d\u6742\u542c\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7Moravec\u6096\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b917\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ecGPT-4\u548cWhisper\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec56.9%\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u768452%\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6574\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses.
