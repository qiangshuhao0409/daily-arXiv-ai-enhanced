*Md Main Uddin Hasan,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AZIZA是一种面向灾难场景的自适应区域智能路由协议，通过区域转发、信任感知和上下文驱动决策，在基础设施受损环境中提供可靠通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国频繁洪水导致通信系统瘫痪，需要不依赖固定基础设施的智能自适应路由解决方案来维持关键通信和应急响应。

Method: 集成区域转发优化本地传输、信任感知逻辑绕过恶意节点、基于信任指标、剩余能量和历史交付模式的上下文驱动决策。

Result: 使用ONE模拟器结合真实移动轨迹和洪水数据的仿真显示，AZIZA在交付可靠性、能效和路由弹性方面显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: AZIZA作为可扩展部署框架，推进了下一代机会路由在传统系统崩溃环境中的应用。

Abstract: Opportunistic routing architectures offer a resilient communication paradigm in environments where conventional networks fail due to disrupted infrastructure, dynamic node mobility, and intermittent connectivity conditions that commonly arise during large-scale disasters. In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience. As a scalable and deployable framework, AZIZA advances the use of next-generation opportunistic routing in environments where traditional systems routinely collapse.

### [2] [Inter-Satellite Link Configuration for Fast Delivery in Low-Earth-Orbit Constellations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15861)
*Arman Mollakhani,Jerayu Tiamraj,Shu-Jie Cao,Dongning Guo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化低地球轨道星座中星间链路布局的方法，以最小化网络直径，从而降低端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LEO星座的星间链路布局很少优化网络直径，而传播延迟是端到端延迟的主要因素，网络直径直接影响最坏情况下的延迟。

Method: 将星间链路选择问题建模为直径最小化问题，使用局部搜索算法迭代优化拓扑结构，在满足物理和硬件约束的同时替换或增强链路。

Result: 所提出的算法在保持星间链路稳定性的同时实现了低最坏情况延迟，并实证测量了跳数与长期链路稳定性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来LEO网络部署提供了直径感知的稀疏图拓扑，具有集中式路由能力，在满足各种约束条件下有效降低了网络延迟。

Abstract: End-to-end latency in large low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations is dominated by propagation delay, making total delay roughly proportional to the network diameter, the longest shortest path in hops. Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.

### [3] [Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder Based Service Migration and Resource Allocation in Satellite Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16011)
*Haotong Wang,Jun Du,Chunxiao Jiang,Jintao Wang,Mérouane Debbah,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于卫星边缘计算的图感知时序编码器(GATE)和混合近端策略优化(HPPO)框架，以解决动态卫星网络中的资源分配和服务迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着延迟敏感应用的快速发展，需要在卫星星座上部署边缘计算能力以实现全球无缝服务覆盖，但面临有限的机载计算通信资源分配和动态卫星轨道带来的服务迁移挑战。

Method: 将问题建模为时空马尔可夫决策过程，提出GATE模型联合建模空间相关性和时序动态，使用两层图卷积网络提取卫星间和用户依赖关系，时序卷积网络捕捉短期演化，最后通过HPPO框架输出离散服务迁移决策和连续资源分配比例。

Result: 通过涉及持续性和间歇性用户的广泛仿真验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决卫星边缘计算中的动态资源分配和服务迁移问题，为全球无缝服务覆盖提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of latency-sensitive applications has sparked renewed interest in deploying edge computing capabilities aboard satellite constellations, aiming to achieve truly global and seamless service coverage. On one hand, it is essential to allocate the limited onboard computational and communication resources efficiently to serve geographically distributed users. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of satellite orbits necessitates effective service migration strategies to maintain service continuity and quality as the coverage areas of satellites evolve. We formulate this problem as a spatio-temporal Markov decision process, where satellites, ground users, and flight users are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph. The node features incorporate queuing dynamics to characterize packet loss probabilities. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph-Aware Temporal Encoder (GATE) that jointly models spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. GATE uses a two-layer graph convolutional network to extract inter-satellite and user dependencies and a temporal convolutional network to capture their short-term evolution, producing unified spatio-temporal representations. The resulting spatial-temporal representations are passed into a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework. This framework features a multi-head actor that outputs both discrete service migration decisions and continuous resource allocation ratios, along with a critic for value estimation. We conduct extensive simulations involving both persistent and intermittent users distributed across real-world population centers.

### [4] [Modeling Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking Delays in Free-Space Optical Satellite Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16063)
*Jason Gerard,Juan A. Fraire,Sandra Céspedes*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一个经过验证的PAT延迟量化模型，该模型整合了来自多个太空任务的数据，揭示了PAT延迟的多模态分布特性及其非线性缩放规律，为光学卫星网络的路由和调度算法提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前调度方法往往忽视或过度简化PAT延迟，导致接触规划效率低下和网络容量被高估，需要更精确的延迟模型来优化光学卫星网络的性能。

Method: 基于NASA TBIRD、LLCD、DSOC和ESA月球光学通信终端的任务数据，建立了一个量化重定向延迟的验证模型，该延迟包括粗指向、精指向和切换到跟踪阶段的延迟。

Result: 发现PAT延迟呈现基于先前链路几何的多模态分布，并且与初始指向不确定性和光学波束宽度呈非线性缩放关系。

Conclusion: 将PAT延迟模型整合到路由和调度算法中，能够实现更精确的接触规划和更高的网络利用率，为未来大规模光学卫星网络的性能评估和算法设计提供基础。

Abstract: Free-space optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) enable high-capacity space communications but require precise Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) between links. Current scheduling approaches often overlook or oversimplify PAT delays, leading to inefficient contact planning and overestimated network capacities. We present a validated model for quantifying retargeting delays, defined as the delay-inducing portion of PAT before data transmission begins, encompassing coarse pointing, fine pointing, and the handover to tracking. The model is grounded in mission data from NASA TBIRD, LLCD, DSOC, and ESA's Lunar Optical Communication Terminal. We find that PAT delays exhibit multimodal distributions based on prior link geometry and scale nonlinearly with initial pointing uncertainty and optical beam width. Integrating these delay models into routing and scheduling algorithms will enable more accurate contact planning and higher utilization in optical networks. The proposed model provides a foundation for evaluating performance and designing algorithms for future large-scale optical satellite networks.

Main category: cs.NI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机集群面临网络管理和编队控制带来的高开销挑战，需要一种能同时优化通信和控制效率的集成方案。

Method: 采用两层分层结构，网络集群与编队共享相同分组；设计融合路由消息与控制信息的路由协议；开发混合仿生控制方法，包括基于鸽子的编队内领导跟随算法和基于椋鸟的编队间避障算法。

Conclusion: BINC方案成功解决了大规模无人机集群的网络与控制集成问题，实现了高效编队管理。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms encounter the challenge of high overhead due to both network management and formation control requirements. In this paper, we propose a Bio-inspired Integrated Networking and Control (BINC) scheme, enabling efficient formation management for swarms comprising thousands of UAVs. The scheme forms a two-layer hierarchical structure, where network clusters and formations share the same groups so that cross-cluster control is eliminated. For networking, we design a fused routing message together with control information to reduce overhead, and limit clusters' size to local two-hop topologies for fast command transmission. For controlling, we develop a hybrid bio-inspired control approach, including a pigeon-like leader-follower algorithm within formations under the consideration of cluster topology maintenance, and a starling-like algorithm among formations that helps to improve the ability of obstacle avoidance. We establish a simulation platform for UAV swarms with over 1000 nodes, and experimental results show that the proposed BINC scheme can achieve highly maneuverable swarm formation marching with significant reduction on communication overhead.

Main category: cs.NI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI工作负载的快速增长与间歇性可再生能源主导的能源格局之间存在矛盾，大量零碳能源被浪费，而传统集中式数据中心架构在能源比例和地理灵活性方面无法适应这一现实。

Conclusion: 可行性感知迁移是未来计算范式的基础构建块，使AI执行变得流动、地理自适应并与可再生能源可用性保持一致。

Abstract: The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.
  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.
  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.

Conclusion: WAB是下一代无线网络实用且可扩展的方法，为网络密集化提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for wireless capacity and coverage has driven research into new radio architectures and higher frequency bands. The recently standardized Wireless Access Backhaul (WAB) architecture represents a key evolution, enabling cost-effective network densification through wireless relaying. This paper presents the first experimental realization of a multi-band WAB testbed, combining an FR2 backhaul and an FR1 access link using open-source software and commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed framework validates the feasibility of end-to-end WAB operation and demonstrates its ability to extend FR2 coverage while maintaining compatibility with legacy FR1 user equipment. Experimental campaigns conducted in vehicular and outdoor-to-indoor scenarios confirm that WAB effectively mitigates the limitations of FR2 links, particularly in uplink and Non-Line-of-Sight conditions. These results highlight WAB as a practical and scalable approach for next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 6G网络面临能源效率的严峻挑战，需要在满足极端服务需求的同时保持可持续性，而传统优化技术能力有限。AI可能提供适应性的网络管理解决方案。

Method: 围绕实际用例组织调查，对每个用例检查AI技术如何贡献于反馈驱动的适应性和动态条件下的快速决策，并基于七个核心动态方面进行评估。

Result: 调查评估了AI方法在6G网络能源效率方面的实际表现，分析了不同用例中AI技术的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文识别了当前研究的空白和未来研究方向，强调了在能源效率与其他6G主要目标（如延迟、可靠性、公平性和覆盖范围）之间进行权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is shaping up to be one of the most challenging issues for 6G networks. The reason is fairly straightforward: Networks will need to meet extreme service demands while remaining sustainable and traditional optimization techniques are too limited. With users moving, traffic swinging unpredictably and services pulling in different directions, management has to be adaptive and AI may offer a way forward. This survey looks at how well AI-based methods actually deliver on that promise. We organize the review around practical use cases. For each use case, we examine how AI techniques contribute to feedback-driven adaptability and rapid decision-making under dynamic conditions. We then evaluate them against seven central dynamic aspects that we consider unavoidable in 6G. The survey also discusses crucial tradeoffs between energy efficiency and the remaining 6G main objectives such as latency, reliability, fairness and coverage, and finally identifies gaps and future research directions.

Abstract: We study a random process over graphs inspired by the way payments are executed in the Lightning Network, the main layer-two solution on top of Bitcoin. We first prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the time it takes for a payment failure to occur, as a function of the number of nodes and the edge capacities, when the underlying graph is complete. Then, we show how such a random process is related to the edge-betweenness centrality measure and we prove upper and lower bounds for arbitrary graphs as a function of edge-betweenness and capacity. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by running extensive simulations over some classes of graphs, including snapshots of the real Lightning Network.

### [10] [CorrectHDL: Agentic HDL Design with LLMs Leveraging High-Level Synthesis as Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16395)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CorrectHDL框架，利用HLS结果作为功能参考来纠正LLM生成的HDL设计中的错误，在保持功能正确性的同时显著提升面积和功耗效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在硬件前端设计中因幻觉倾向导致的功能错误问题，同时结合LLM的生成能力和传统HLS工具的正确性保证

Method: 使用C/C++程序作为输入，通过LLM生成HDL设计，用RAG机制修复语法错误，并通过与HLS参考设计的仿真行为比较来迭代改进功能正确性

Result: 生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持功能正确性

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了代理式HDL设计的潜力和有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Conclusion: eLLM提供了一个可扩展且可靠的基于分类法的分类解决方案，可能显著减少对人工专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型推理系统经常在不同任务中重复计算相似的推理步骤，浪费计算资源，增加推理延迟，限制可重现性。需要持久化推理机制来回忆和重用先前的计算痕迹。

Method: 引入图记忆推理框架，将推理工作流表示为图结构记忆，通过结构和语义相似性检索过去的决策图，实现跨新推理任务的子图组合重用。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体强化学习系统应用于安全关键领域，理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式变得至关重要。现有可解释AI方法在多智能体环境中存在不足，无法将集体结果归因于个体、量化涌现行为或捕捉复杂交互。

Result: 在四个多智能体强化学习场景（合作、竞争和混合动机）中评估显示：准确的结果归因（平均φ_i=5.07，标准差<0.05），在合作任务中检测到积极涌现（协同指数高达0.461），计算效率高（CPU上每个数据集0.79秒）。

Conclusion: MACIE独特地结合了因果严谨性、涌现量化和多智能体支持，同时保持实时使用的实用性，代表了向可解释、可信赖和可问责的多智能体AI迈出的一步。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同模态（文本和图像）如何影响模型在ARC-AGI任务中的感知能力，发现结构化文本能精确捕捉稀疏特征坐标，图像能保持2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提升执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将网格转换为自然语言或DSL规则执行，但缺乏对编码如何影响模型感知的系统性分析，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。假设不同模态会形成感知瓶颈，影响网格特征的可靠感知。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，采用两阶段推理流程，比较不同表示方式对模型感知的影响。

Result: 结构化文本能精确获取稀疏特征坐标，图像能捕捉2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合文本和图像能提高约8个感知点和0.20中位数相似度的执行准确性。

Conclusion: 将表示与transformer归纳偏置对齐，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下获得更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Conclusion: ToolMind通过轮次级验证方法缓解了训练中的错误放大问题，同时保留了自我纠正推理信号，为稳健的工具使用学习提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

### [16] [Chain of Summaries: Summarization Through Iterative Questioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15719)
*William Brach,Lukas Galke Poech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Chain of Summaries (CoS)方法，通过类似黑格尔辩证法的方式迭代生成信息密集的通用摘要，解决LLM处理网页内容时的格式不友好和上下文长度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地使用外部网页内容，但这些内容由于格式不友好和上下文长度限制难以被LLMs有效消化。

Method: CoS方法：初始摘要（正题）→通过提问识别局限性（反题）→生成通用摘要（合题），迭代精炼以满足当前和未来信息需求。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升66%，比专业摘要方法BRIO和PEGASUS提升27%。CoS生成的摘要用更少token实现更高Q&A性能，且与下游LLM无关。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了一种使内容更易被LLMs访问的吸引人选项，同时保留人工监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Conclusion: 多模态AI框架能够有效结合文本和视觉数据分析，为建筑安全监控提供可行的解决方案，特别是在资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一致性引导跨模态迁移的不确定性弹性多模态学习方法，通过跨模态语义一致性实现鲁棒表示学习，在共享潜在空间中缓解模态差距并揭示支持不确定性估计的结构关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统面临数据噪声、低质量标签和异质模态特性带来的不确定性，特别是在人机交互环境中，数据质量、语义可靠性和标注一致性在不同用户和记录条件下存在差异。

Method: 使用跨模态语义一致性作为鲁棒表示学习的基础，通过将异质模态投影到共享潜在空间来缓解模态差距，并探索支持不确定性估计和稳定特征学习的结构关系。

Result: 在多模态情感识别基准测试中，一致性引导跨模态迁移显著提高了模型稳定性、判别能力和对噪声或不完整监督的鲁棒性。潜在空间分析表明该框架即使在挑战性条件下也能捕捉可靠的跨模态结构。

Conclusion: 该论文通过整合不确定性建模、语义对齐和数据高效监督，为弹性多模态学习提供了统一视角，为开发可靠和自适应的脑机接口系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在领域特定应用中存在知识差距，且在需要多步推理的复杂问题上表现下降。为了提升生物力学本科课程的教学效果，需要开发专门的教育助手来解决这些问题。

Method: 1) 使用RAG增强LLM对概念判断题的特异性和逻辑一致性；2) 构建MAS系统来解决需要多步推理和代码执行的计算导向问题。评估了多个LLM在包含100个概念判断题和方程推导计算问题的生物力学数据集上的表现。

Result: RAG显著提升了LLM在回答概念问题上的性能和稳定性，超越了原始模型。MAS系统展示了执行多步推理、推导方程、执行代码和为计算任务生成可解释解决方案的能力。

Conclusion: RAG和MAS的应用为提升LLM在工程专业课程中的表现提供了有前景的方向，展示了在工程教育中开发智能辅导系统的潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

TL;DR: 多智能体编排相比单智能体方法在事件响应中实现了100%可操作建议率，提升了80倍行动特异性和140倍解决方案正确性，且质量零方差，使生产SLA承诺成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体LLM方法生成模糊、不可用的建议，无法满足生产系统事件响应的需求。

Method: 开发了MyAntFarm.ai框架，通过348次对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事件场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现100%可操作建议率，而单智能体仅为1.7%；行动特异性提升80倍，解决方案正确性提升140倍；多智能体系统在所有试验中质量方差为零。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排从性能优化转变为LLM事件响应的生产就绪要求，引入了决策质量(DQ)新指标来评估有效性、特异性和正确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Motivation: 当前AI风险评估主要关注算法偏见和模型幻觉等问题，但在关键应用中使用的AI系统，其复杂的供应链（包括数据源、预训练模型、服务等）风险缺乏系统评估，这构成了重要的研究空白。

Method: 作者调查了当前AI风险评估和管理现状，重点关注AI供应链及其行为输出相关风险，然后提出了一个专门用于分类AI供应链实体的分类法。

Conclusion: 该研究在当前AI治理状态与关键应用中AI使用的可操作风险评估和管理的迫切需求之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Motivation: 理解激活引导如何改变LLM内部机制以提升心理理论能力，特别是情感处理与分析推理在其中的作用。

Method: 使用对比激活加法（CAA）引导Gemma-3-4B模型，在1000个BigToM前向信念场景上评估，通过线性探针分析45种认知行为的激活差异。

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，情感感知（+2.23）和情感价值（+2.20）激活增强，而质疑（-0.78）和收敛思维（-1.59）等分析过程被抑制。

Conclusion: LLM成功的心智理论能力主要由情感理解而非分析推理介导。

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-judge框架依赖答案与真实标签或其他答案的间接比较，难以完全自动化，对推理输出的细粒度可扩展评估支持有限。需要更直接的评估方法。

Method: 提出JudgeBoard评估管道，直接查询模型评估答案正确性。开发MAJ多智能体评判框架，利用多个具有不同推理特征的小型语言模型通过协作审议来近似LLM级判断准确性。

Result: 实验显示SLM和LLM在独立判断任务中存在显著性能差距，但MAJ框架显著提高了SLM的可靠性和一致性。在MATH数据集上，使用较小模型作为骨干的MAJ表现与较大模型相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 多智能体SLM系统在判断任务中有潜力匹配或超过LLM性能，对可扩展和高效评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KRAL是一个低成本、可扩展、保护隐私的范式，通过教师模型推理自动提取知识和推理轨迹，使用启发式学习进行半监督数据增强，并利用智能强化学习联合增强医学知识和推理能力，显著优于传统RAG和SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床决策中的局限性，包括知识差距、数据隐私问题、高部署成本和有限推理能力，以支持复杂医疗决策。

Method: 使用教师模型推理自动提取知识和推理轨迹，通过答案到问题的反向生成；采用启发式学习进行半监督数据增强（减少约80%手动标注需求）；利用智能强化学习联合增强医学知识和推理能力；采用分层评估和模块化接口设计。

Result: 在外部开源基准MEDQA上，知识问答能力（Accuracy@1）比SFT提高1.8%，比RAG提高3.6%；在外部基准PUMCH Antimicrobial上，推理能力（Pass@1）比SFT和RAG均提高约27%；长期训练成本仅为SFT的约20%。

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLM临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，可在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合语义漂移分析和金丝雀基线比较的双重方法检测系统，用于实时识别被植入后门的大型语言模型，在官方测试模型上达到92.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能被植入后门，在特定部署条件下表现出恶意行为，而现有方法无法有效检测这种"潜伏代理"现象。

Method: 使用Sentence-BERT嵌入测量与安全基线的语义偏差，并结合注入的金丝雀问题监控响应一致性，形成双重检测系统。

Result: 在官方Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B潜伏代理模型上，系统达到92.5%准确率、100%精确度（零误报）和85%召回率，实时运行（<1秒/查询）。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测能有效识别欺骗性模型行为，且不影响部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Motivation: 在临床环境中，检索到正确证据并不能保证大语言模型能够正确推理，这种检索与推理之间的差距可能导致输出不符合结构化协议，存在安全风险。

Method: 使用书面暴露疗法指南作为测试平台，评估模型对经过临床医生审核的问题的响应，提出了衡量准确性、一致性和推理保真度的评估框架。

Result: 即使提供权威段落，模型错误仍然存在。检索增强生成可以约束输出，但安全部署需要严格评估推理质量。

Conclusion: 在临床应用中，必须像评估检索一样严格评估大语言模型的推理能力，检索增强生成虽有潜力但需要更全面的评估框架来确保安全部署。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的约束规划模型，用于解决考虑最小批次大小的串行批次调度问题，避免了现有方法依赖预定义虚拟批次集合的问题，在中小规模实例上表现优越，在大规模实例上能比现有方法找到好25%的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束规划模型依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，这会导致维度灾难并增加问题复杂度。许多实际应用（如半导体制造中的离子注入）都需要考虑最小批次大小要求。

Method: 提出不依赖虚拟批次集合的新CP模型，使用关键对齐参数直接在机器上调度同族作业序列，采用更紧凑的公式表示，并通过定制搜索阶段和增强约束传播器推理级别来改进模型。

Result: 在近5000个实例上的计算实验表明，新模型在最多100个作业的中小规模实例上表现优越，在最多500个作业、10个族、10台机器的大规模实例上，能找到比现有方法好25%的解。

Conclusion: 新CP模型通过避免虚拟批次集合和利用问题结构，在串行批次调度问题上显著优于现有方法，包括混合整数规划、禁忌搜索和传统CP方法。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Method: 构建研究焦点（会计中心vsAI中心）和方法论（AI方法vs传统方法）的二维分类框架，应用于IJAIS特刊和主要会计期刊的AI-会计研究论文分析。

Result: 发现GenAI虽然民主化了某些研究能力，但通过提高对高阶贡献的期望加剧了竞争，人类在判断力、创造力和理论深度方面仍具价值。

Conclusion: 需要改革博士教育以培养比较优势，同时建立AI素养，帮助会计学者在AI时代保持竞争力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Motivation: 传统的云边缘资源管理过于被动，依赖静态阈值会导致资源过度配置或性能下降，需要转向主动预测性解决方案。

Method: 设计混合架构，将CNN-LSTM模型的预测结果嵌入到多智能体深度强化学习的状态空间中，使AI管理器能够预见未来状态并做出长期优化决策。

Result: 测试表明该系统明显优于传统方法，能够有效解决复杂决策问题，同时平衡成本节约、系统健康和应用程序性能等多个目标。

Conclusion: 通过将预测能力嵌入强化学习框架，实现了更智能的资源管理，能够在长期规划中找到成本与性能的最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Method: 采用优化的异步管道调度器（1.55倍加速），结合基于AST的搜索工具增强训练配方，支持与SkyRL-train、VeRL、Tinker等现有RL框架的无缝集成。

Result: 训练的SA-SWE-32B智能体在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，相比达到相似性能的先前模型成本降低2倍以上，并能有效泛化到其他智能体任务。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗实践中具有变革潜力，但其实际临床效用受到三个关键对齐挑战的限制：静态评估基准与动态临床认知需求脱节、难以适应不断发展的多源医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准。

Method: 提出MR-RML框架，包含三个核心创新：(1) "维度-场景-学科"医疗标准系统，将领域标准嵌入完整训练流程；(2) 独立多维奖励模型，分解评估标准；(3) 几何投影参考约束，将医疗认知逻辑转化为数学正则化。

Result: 在权威医疗基准Healthbench上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B性能显著提升（完整子集45%，困难子集85%），在开源LLMs中达到SOTA水平（完整子集62.7分，困难子集44.7分），并优于大多数闭源模型。

Conclusion: MR-RML框架通过结构化医疗标准系统和几何约束，有效解决了LLMs在医疗领域的对齐问题，显著提升了模型在复杂医疗任务中的表现。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集通过整合计算机视觉和战术知识，为自动化提取足球逐场数据提供了新的解决方案，推动了体育分析的发展。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Conclusion: 这种整合将使领域从盲目搜索转向可解释的、特定类别的算法设计，在产生可重用科学洞察的同时加速进展。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分原因缺乏透明度。

Method: 将偏好评估分解为领域特定智能体产生部分信号，结合全局评估器（如排序器和嵌入相似性奖励），中央聚合器融合这些信号生成单一训练奖励。

Result: CRM与rewardBench基准结合，为透明奖励建模和稳定优化提供了实用的模块化路径。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作奖励模型框架能够在不增加人工标注的情况下，实现多视角奖励塑造，提高RLHF的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

TL;DR: ChemO是一个基于国际化学奥林匹克竞赛的新基准，通过评估等效重构和结构化视觉增强解决化学问题自动评估的挑战，ChemLabs多智能体框架实现了93.6/100的优异成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学和物理的奥林匹克级基准是AI推理的重要测试平台，但化学因其独特的多模态符号语言一直是个开放挑战，需要专门的基准来评估AI的化学推理能力。

Method: 提出ChemO基准，包含评估等效重构(AER)将视觉输出问题转化为可计算格式，结构化视觉增强(SVE)分离视觉感知与化学推理能力；开发ChemLabs分层多智能体框架，模拟人类专家协作。

Conclusion: ChemO基准和ChemLabs框架成功解决了化学奥林匹克级问题的自动评估挑战，证明了多智能体协作在复杂化学推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了真实世界教育内容的大规模利用，为改进面向推理的LLM训练提供了合成数据生成的实用替代方案

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于项目生命周期的新型公平感知交互推荐方法LHRL，通过分层强化学习框架动态平衡公平性和准确性，在多个真实数据集上显著提升了公平性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视公平感知交互推荐，发现短视频平台中项目生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式（快速增长、短暂稳定、急剧衰减），与传统四阶段模型显著不同，这为公平推荐提供了新的控制维度。

Method: 提出LHRL框架：包含PhaseFormer（结合STL分解和注意力机制的轻量级阶段检测器）和两级HRL代理（高层策略施加阶段感知公平约束，低层策略优化即时用户参与），实现解耦优化。

Result: 在多个真实交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著提高了公平性和用户参与度，且将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型中也能持续获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 项目生命周期是平衡推荐系统公平性和准确性的有效控制维度，LHRL框架具有通用性和实用价值，为公平推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多意图科学问答基准MuISQA，并设计了一个意图感知检索框架，通过LLM假设答案、分解意图特定查询，并使用RRF重排来提升多意图问题的证据覆盖率和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常面向单一意图，无法充分覆盖复杂科学问题中多个子意图所需的异质证据，导致证据覆盖不完整。

Method: 提出意图感知检索框架：利用LLM假设潜在答案，分解为意图特定查询，检索各意图的支持段落，通过RRF聚合重排以平衡不同意图的覆盖并减少冗余。

Result: 在MuISQA基准和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖率方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能有效解决多意图科学问答中的证据覆盖问题，显著提升RAG系统在复杂问题上的表现。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Motivation: 探索多个组织（诊所、保险公司、专科网络）如何通过假名化案例令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界实现安全协作，同时保持数据本地化。

Method: 使用Orpius平台进行多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信。所有代理通过OperationRelay调用交换简洁的自然语言摘要，每个代理仅操作自己的数据，使用HMAC假名化令牌进行身份保护。

Result: 成功演示了分布式系统间代理通信的可行性，展示了架构模式、隐私考量和通信流程，使专业代理能够进行分布式推理。

Conclusion: 该原型证明了去中心化多代理系统的可行性，为未来更严格的评估和研究奠定了基础，强调了在保持数据本地化的同时实现分布式推理的可能性。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Motivation: 当前企业不信任AI代理处理生产数据，传统数据湖仓不适合代理访问模式，需要重新设计基础设施来确保代理工作流的可信性。

Method: 提出Bauplan设计，重新实现数据湖仓中的数据与计算隔离机制，借鉴数据库MVCC思想但针对解耦、多语言环境进行专门设计。

Result: 实现了自修复管道的参考实现，无缝耦合代理推理与正确性和可信性保证。

Conclusion: 通过先解决基础设施问题，设计面向代理的数据湖仓，可以建立可信的代理工作流，治理问题随之解决。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Conclusion: 该框架为金融治理和决策中的ESG整合提供了更好的支持，并发布了首个大规模公开ESG报告数据集Aurora-ESG。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Result: 在9个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TOFA在各种联邦设置下均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: TOFA是一种高效、轻量级的训练免费联邦VLM适应框架，能充分利用预训练VLM的多模态特征，有效处理数据异质性。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算工具大多无法追踪痴呆症患者日常沟通行为的渐进变化，而护理人员只能非正式地注意到这些变化。需要专门工具来检测这种随时间推移的行为漂移。

Method: 基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户模型，模拟60天交互日志。评估多种异常检测方法：无监督统计方法（CUSUM、EWMA、One-Class SVM）、使用上下文嵌入的序列模型（GRU+BERT）以及监督分类器。

Result: 初步结果显示：情感扁平化在基线变异性低的用户中可用简单统计模型检测，而语义漂移检测需要时序建模和个性化基线。个性化分类器在所有任务中都优于通用分类器。

Conclusion: 个性化行为上下文对于检测痴呆症患者沟通行为变化至关重要，个性化方法在检测渐进沟通变化方面表现更优。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

Conclusion: CLOZE框架成功展示了利用大语言模型从临床笔记中自动扩展医学本体的可行性，为零样本、隐私保护的生物医学本体构建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为数字AI意识可能性的辩论提供结构和工具，澄清对计算功能主义的挑战与对数字意识的挑战之间的区别。

Method: 开发了一个分类框架，基于Marr的层次理论识别挑战的粒度级别，并区分三种力度的挑战：对计算功能主义的挑战、实践性挑战和严格不可能性论证。

Result: 应用该框架分析了14个来自科学和哲学文献的著名例子，成功实现了挑战的分类和澄清。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字意识辩论提供了有价值的结构和分析工具，有助于更清晰地理解不同类型的挑战及其含义。

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解释方法ALEs，结合了基于案例推理模型的内在可解释性和形式化XAI的保证，解决了原型解释可能误导的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于案例推理网络虽然天生具有可解释性，但其原型解释有时会产生误导，特别是在安全关键场景中，不同预测可能具有相同解释，这限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 提出了Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs)形式化方法，在实例的中间表示上表达充分条件以暗示预测结果。开发了无求解器和可扩展的算法，基于三种不同范式生成ALEs。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的可行性，包括标准图像分类和细粒度图像分类任务。

Conclusion: ALEs方法成功结合了基于案例推理模型的内在可解释性和形式化XAI的保证，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的解释机制。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

TL;DR: D-GARA是一个动态基准测试框架，用于评估Android GUI代理在现实异常环境中的鲁棒性，填补了现有静态基准测试无法反映真实复杂环境的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理数据集和基准测试大多是静态和理想化的，无法反映现实环境的复杂性和不可预测性，特别是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出D-GARA框架，引入多种现实世界异常（如权限对话框、电池警告、更新提示等），构建包含嵌入式异常的Android应用基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，在异常丰富的环境中，最先进的GUI代理性能显著下降，突显了对鲁棒性学习的迫切需求。

Conclusion: D-GARA是模块化和可扩展的，支持无缝集成新任务、异常类型和交互场景，以满足特定的评估目标。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

TL;DR: YOFO是一种基于模板的多模态大语言模型评估方法，通过单次前向传播同时判断所有结构化需求，在保持可解释性的同时实现数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评估方法面临基本权衡：适应MLLM输出单个分数与生成性质不符且限制细粒度需求理解，而自回归生成评估分析在高吞吐量场景下速度过慢。

Method: 提出YOFO方法，基于自回归模型接受结构化需求模板，在单次推理步骤中通过读取与每个需求相关的最终token的logits，为每个需求生成二元是/否决策。

Result: 在标准推荐数据集上实现最先进结果，支持依赖感知分析（后续判断基于先前判断），并能从后验思维链中获益。

Conclusion: YOFO在保持可解释性的同时实现数量级速度提升，解决了MLLM评估中的速度与细粒度理解之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能面临的两个主要挑战：真实世界数据稀缺昂贵（数据瓶颈），以及现有方法算法效率低下、资源消耗大。

Method: 引入DPPO（Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization）训练框架，采用元认知"Metaloop"机制，在监督微调（能力扩展）和强化学习（技能精炼）之间动态切换，实现自动弱点识别和针对性资源分配。

Result: 基于DPPO训练的视觉语言具身模型Pelican-VL 1.0相比基础模型性能提升20.3%，在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%。

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性缓解数据和资源瓶颈的框架，使社区能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一个轻量级贝叶斯增强框架，用于transformer临床语言模型，旨在产生可靠、不确定性感知的预测，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但容易过度自信，特别是在需要校准不确定性的模糊医疗案例中。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边际化）、置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学QA和临床预测基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite持续改善校准和可信度，将过度自信降低32-48%。在模拟临床环境中，可通过标记不确定预测供人工审查预防高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: 该框架有效实现了可靠的不确定性传播，并提高了医疗AI系统的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Conclusion: FRIS通过元件位置可重构性为物理层安全提供了重要性能提升，是RIS技术的有价值升级。

Abstract: The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).
