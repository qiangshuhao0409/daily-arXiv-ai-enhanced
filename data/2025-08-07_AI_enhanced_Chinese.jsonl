This paper\nmodels data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting\ncodes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments\nof the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)\ninside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for\nsuccessful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one\nsufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first\nshow that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily\nsolved using existing tools. Then, we introduce novel encoding schemes for\ntwo-dimensional information (i.e., a matrix), and three-dimensional information\n(i.e., a cube) which enable the information to be decoded from any sufficiently\nlarge rectangle-shaped or cuboid-shaped fragment. Lastly, we introduce a code\nthat is also capable of correcting bit-flip errors, using techniques from\nrecently proposed codes for DNA storage.

Our module constructs frequency-domain channel\nmatrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control\n(MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based\nchannel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP\nimplementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity.\nThis new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT)\ncapabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking\nstudies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage\nmitigation, and environment-aware sensing.

Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the\ninstability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy\nsources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel\nTwo-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power\nsystem dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The\nframework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead\nstochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The\nformer is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability,\nwhile in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an\nadaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nagent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to\ndynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal\ncarbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system\nintegrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform\nbaseline approaches.

In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property\nestimation to socioeconomic prediction.

This framework\napplies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)\nconstruction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the\nworst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and\nenables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows\ntwo composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of\nminimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.\nCompared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve\na notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle.

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative\nReasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from\nprobability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MERA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u7ba1\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406-\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u53caControl-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMERA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MERA\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
