### [1] [One task to rule them all: A closer look at traffic classification generalizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06430)
*Elham Akbari,Zihao Zhou,Mohammad Ali Salahuddin,Noura Limam,Raouf Boutaba,Bertrand Mathieu,Stephanie Moteau,Stephane Tuffin*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现有网站指纹和流量分类解决方案在评估环境变化时性能下降的问题，提出了一个考虑实际标签限制的评估框架，并展示了不同模型在分布偏移下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案的性能依赖于特定环境的假设，导致在环境变化时表现不佳，需要研究其泛化能力。

Method: 通过将三种现有解决方案的模型应用于彼此的数据集，识别导致性能差异的特定属性和假设，并设计了一个模拟现实标签限制的评估框架。

Result: 在分布偏移下，最佳解决方案的性能仅为30%至40%，而简单的1-Nearest Neighbor分类器表现接近。

Conclusion: 研究强调了现有模型在分布偏移下的局限性，并提出了更公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Existing website fingerprinting and traffic classification solutions do not
work well when the evaluation context changes, as their performances often
heavily rely on context-specific assumptions. To clarify this problem, we take
three prior solutions presented for different but similar traffic
classification and website fingerprinting tasks, and apply each solution's
model to another solution's dataset. We pinpoint dataset-specific and
model-specific properties that lead each of them to overperform in their
specific evaluation context.
  As a realistic evaluation context that takes practical labeling constraints
into account, we design an evaluation framework using two recent real-world TLS
traffic datasets from large-scale networks. The framework simulates a
futuristic scenario in which SNIs are hidden in some networks but not in
others, and the classifier's goal is to predict destination services in one
network's traffic, having been trained on a labelled dataset collected from a
different network. Our framework has the distinction of including real-world
distribution shift, while excluding concept drift. We show that, even when
abundant labeled data is available, the best solutions' performances under
distribution shift are between 30% and 40%, and a simple 1-Nearest Neighbor
classifier's performance is not far behind. We depict all performances measured
on different models, not just the best ones, for a fair representation of
traffic models in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市化进程加快，传统地面交通无法有效解决拥堵问题，AAM系统（特别是eVTOL）成为解决方案，但URLLC技术不成熟导致安全挑战。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization and increasing population density, urban traffic
congestion has become a critical issue, and traditional ground transportation
methods are no longer sufficient to address it effectively. To tackle this
challenge, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged, aiming to
utilize low-altitude airspace to establish a three-dimensional transportation
system. Among various components of the AAM system, electric vertical take-off
and landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a pivotal role due to their flexibility and
efficiency. However, the immaturity of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication
(URLLC) technologies poses significant challenges to safety-critical AAM
operations. Specifically, existing Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM)-based
eVTOL systems lack rigorous mathematical frameworks to quantify probabilistic
delay bounds under dynamic air traffic patterns, a prerequisite for collision
avoidance and airspace management. To bridge this gap, we employ network
calculus tools to derive the probabilistic upper bound on communication delay
in the AAM system for the first time. Furthermore, we formulate a complex
non-convex optimization problem that jointly minimizes the probabilistic delay
bound and the propagation delay. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose
a solution based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm and
Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) method. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of how various factors impact regret and transmission rate, and
explore the influence of varying load intensity and total delay on the
probabilistic delay bound.

### [3] [Beyond Connectivity: An Open Architecture for AI-RAN Convergence in 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06911)

Abstract: The proliferation of data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications
at the network edge demands a fundamental shift in RAN design, from merely
consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI
workloads. This paradigm shift presents a significant opportunity for network
operators to monetize AI at the edge while leveraging existing infrastructure
investments. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged
O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both
telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed
architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and
cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key
architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN
Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and
allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide
distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The
proposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to
be orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch
processing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the
orchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different
time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor
interoperability.

### [4] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个三维多人模拟工具，用于模拟战场医疗后送网络，提升学员对医疗后送任务的理解和协作决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络并评估规划和决策的工具。

Method: 开发了基于Unity的MEWI模拟器，模拟战场约束和不确定性，并引入两个实战场景进行测试。

Result: MEWI显著提升了学员对医疗后送知识的掌握和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真训练工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗后送教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [5] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)的新方法，用于解决LLM提示工程的复杂性，通过声明式表示提升程序员效率并支持优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架要么通过限制性API隐藏复杂性，要么提供难以自定义的固定模式，导致复杂代理编程困难。

Method: 提出PDL，将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动提示调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。

Result: 通过合规代理的案例研究，PDL将性能提升至4倍。

Conclusion: PDL通过声明式表示和抽象复杂性，显著提升了提示工程的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [6] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究验证了Jolting Technologies假说，提出AI能力可能呈现超指数增长，并通过模拟验证了检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI能力发展的潜在超指数增长模式及其对AGI出现的影响。

Method: 开发理论框架，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，分析缩短的创意到行动间隔和迭代改进的作用。

Result: 提供了数学基础和检测工具，为未来实证研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: 研究为理解AI发展轨迹及其政策意义提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [7] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，后者又比d-辩证系统更强，突出了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统在自动信念修正中的能力差异，特别是q-辩证系统的优越性。

Method: 通过理论证明比较d-、p-和q-辩证系统的能力。

Result: q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，后者又严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 反例和矛盾在信念修正中具有互补作用，q-辩证系统提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [8] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架（AFs），提出了两种方法，并通过Baroni和Giacomin的标准评估其有效性，发现方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限AFs中有效，但在无限AFs中因缺乏良基性而失效，需扩展其适用性。

Method: 提出两种扩展SCC递归语义到无限AFs的方法，并系统评估其是否符合Baroni和Giacomin的标准。

Result: 发现方向性在无限AFs中一般失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究推动了无限论证理论的发展，为处理无界或动态领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [9] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择、数据合成和模型诊断生成高质量指令数据集，提升模型的指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集在覆盖范围和深度上有限，导致模型在复杂指令和罕见领域任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型诊断生成，形成闭环迭代提升数据质量。

Result: 构建了InfinityInstruct-Subject数据集（约150万指令），实验证明其能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为指令数据集的高效持续进化提供了理论和实践基础，从数量扩展转向质量提升。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态旅行规划系统，通过三个协作代理解决现有系统的不足，显著提升了查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界中的复杂变化和意外干扰，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 提出三个协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间定位和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG技术应对干扰）。

Result: 系统在查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多种应用中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E是一种结构化探索框架，通过识别推理轨迹中的高不确定性决策点并提供针对性反馈，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题，需要更结构化的探索方法。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，识别高不确定性决策点，进行针对性rollout以生成语义明确的中间反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升了训练稳定性、生成了更长且更连贯的响应，并增加了完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过更稳健和结构化的探索，有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, the existence of perfect and quasi-perfect splitter sets in
finite abelian groups is studied, motivated by their application in coding
theory for flash memory storage. For perfect splitter sets we view them as
splittings of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, and using cyclotomic polynomials we derive a
general condition for the existence of such splittings under certain
circumstances. We further establish a relation between $B[-k, k](q)$ and
$B[-(k-1), k+1](q)$ splitter sets, and give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of perfect $B[-1, 5](q)$ splitter sets. Finally,
two nonexistence results for quasi-perfect splitter sets are presented.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合量子卷积神经网络（HQCNN），用于优化无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中的导频分配任务，显著提升总遍历和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的解决方案效率低且计算量大，传统深度神经网络在高维输入下表现不佳且收敛慢。

Method: 利用参数化量子电路（PQCs）的叠加特性增强特征提取，并在所有卷积层中共享同一PQC以加速收敛。

Result: 数值结果表明，HQCNN的网络吞吐量接近复杂度极高的穷举搜索，并优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: HQCNN在性能和效率上均优于传统方法，为高维任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A sophisticated hybrid quantum convolutional neural network (HQCNN) is
conceived for handling the pilot assignment task in cell-free massive MIMO
systems, while maximizing the total ergodic sum throughput. The existing
model-based solutions found in the literature are inefficient and/or
computationally demanding. Similarly, conventional deep neural networks may
struggle in the face of high-dimensional inputs, require complex architectures,
and their convergence is slow due to training numerous hyperparameters. The
proposed HQCNN leverages parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) relying on
superposition for enhanced feature extraction. Specifically, we exploit the
same PQC across all the convolutional layers for customizing the neural network
and for accelerating the convergence. Our numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed HQCNN offers a total network throughput close to that of the
excessive-complexity exhaustive search and outperforms the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可重构天线需要逐个元素控制，而柔性连续变形天线阵列通过结构级灵活性提升性能。

Method: 采用幅度和空间频率参数建模变形，通过连续凸逼近方法优化变形参数以最大化网络总速率。

Result: 数值结果表明，该可变形阵列在总速率上显著优于固定几何和单元素可重构阵列。

Conclusion: 结构级灵活性为下一代天线阵列提供了显著优势。

Abstract: In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is
proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements.
The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of
its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element
control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial
frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output
downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to
maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method
is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed
deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element
reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of
structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索窗口解码（WD）在空间耦合低密度奇偶校验（LDPC）码中如何平衡性能与复杂度，并研究信息传播的特性。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究信息在WD下的波状传播特性，并推导二进制擦除通道上的信息传播速度上界。

Result: 证明了信息在WD下以恒定速度波状传播，并提供了传播速度的上界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计窗口解码的迭代次数提供了理论依据，优化了LDPC码的解码效率。

Abstract: It is known that windowed decoding (WD) can effectively balance the
performance and complexity of spatially coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes. In this study, we show that information can propagate in a wave-like
manner at a constant speed under WD. Additionally, we provide an upper bound
for the information propagation speed on the binary erasure channel, which can
assist in designing the number of iterations required within each window.

### [16] [On the Error Exponent Distribution of Code Ensembles over Classical-Quantum Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06868)
*Giuseppe Cocco,Javier Rodríguez Fonollosa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文表明，在低速率下，i.i.d.码集合在经典-量子信道中的错误指数概率分布会累积在高于CQ随机编码指数的阈值上，而在接近信道互信息速率时与之重合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究经典-量子信道中i.i.d.码集合的错误指数分布特性，以揭示其在高速率和低速率下的不同行为。

Method: 通过分析i.i.d.码集合在经典-量子信道中的错误指数分布，结合Dalai、Renes以及Li和Yang的工作。

Result: 在高速率下，错误指数分布集中在CQ随机编码指数附近；在相同速率下，推导的阈值与典型随机编码指数一致。

Conclusion: 错误指数分布在高、低速率下表现出不同的集中特性，且在高速率下与典型随机编码指数一致。

Abstract: We show that the probability distribution of the error exponent in i.i.d.
code ensembles over classical-quantum (CQ) channels with arbitrary output
states accumulates above a threshold that is strictly larger than the CQ random
coding exponent (RCE) at low rates, while coinciding with it at rates close to
the mutual information of the channel. This result, combined with the work by
Dalai [1] and the recent ones by Renes [2] and Li and Yang [3], implies that
the ensemble distribution of error exponents concentrates around the CQ RCE in
the high rate regime. Moreover, in the same rate regime the threshold we derive
coincides with the ensemble-average of the exponent, that is, the typical
random coding (TRC) exponent [4].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设衰落信道服从高斯分布，而本文旨在提出一种仅依赖信道一阶和二阶矩的高效算法。

Abstract: This paper seeks an efficient algorithm for stochastic precoding to maximize
the long-term average weighted sum rates throughout a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) network. Unlike many existing works that assume a
particular probability distribution model for fading channels (which is
typically Gaussian), our approach merely relies on the first and second moments
of fading channels. For the stochastic precoding problem, a naive idea is to
directly apply the fractional programming (FP) method to the data rate inside
the expectation; it does not work well because the auxiliary variables
introduced by FP are then difficult to decide. To address the above issue, we
propose using a lower bound to approximate the expectation of data rate. This
lower bound stems from a nontrivial use of the matrix FP, and outperforms the
existing lower bounds in that it accounts for generalized fading channels whose
first and second moments are known. The resulting approximate problem can be
efficiently solved in closed form in an iterative fashion. Furthermore, for
large-scale MIMO, we improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by
eliminating the large matrix inverse. Simulations show that the proposed
stochastic precoding method outperforms the benchmark methods in both Gaussian
and non-Gaussian fading channel cases.
