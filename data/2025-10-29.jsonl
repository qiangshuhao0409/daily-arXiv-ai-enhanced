This\npaper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess\npuzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then\nintroduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search\nstatistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to\nenhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism.\nOur RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by\n10x, from 0.22\\% (supervised) to 2.5\\%, surpassing existing dataset rates\n(2.1\\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\\%). Our puzzles meet novelty\nand diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human\nexperts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book\npuzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated\nbooklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by\nthree world-renowned experts."}

As a result, how to check their outputs\neffectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their\napplications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,\nsuch as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate\nprompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to\nspecific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors\nof LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.\nSpecifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input\nproblem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning\ncorrectness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the\ncalculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which\navoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated\nprompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method\nto reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance\nimprovements than other voting and verification methods with very few\ncomputational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales\nand model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It\nachieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from\nincorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning\nbenchmarks by more than 8%."}

We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that\nmodels tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable\ncomplexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a\ngraph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset\npresents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is\neffective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance\nof leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use."}

Our method begins by\nconstructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,\narguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In\nparallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and\nSOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we\nadopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool\ndependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this\nunified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan\ngeneration, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain\nknowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning."}

This work focuses on a seeded\nmodular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output\nfeedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned\nfeedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We\nstudy the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,\nillustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between\nlegitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our\nfindings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,\nto be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods."}

However, their deployment in real-world LEO\nsatellite systems remains largely unexplored, hindered by limited onboard\ncomputing resources and brief satellite-ground contacts. We propose Grace, a\nsatellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference\nin RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime\ninference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end\nperformance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous\nsatellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch\nalgorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite\narchive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground\ndata exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that\neither processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS.\nExtensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that\nGrace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, without compromising inference accuracy."}
