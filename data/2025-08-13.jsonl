One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an\nenhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the\nperformance."}

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison\nbetween a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that\nthe latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having\ntool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid\nframework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a\nCode Agent handles code generation and execution.

In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time.
