Once reserved\nfor a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with\ntraffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite\nthis proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the\nInternet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive\nto conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring\ntheir products further complicates measurement efforts.\n  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),\nthat derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster\nthese otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward\nactive reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing\nand interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves\nambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC\ninterpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices\nthat create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP\nsystematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that\ntranslate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable\nfingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its\npractical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative\nprobes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including\nmajor nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products. We\ndiscuss how our fingerprinting methodology generalizes beyond censorship to\nother forms of targeted interference."}

Recent advancements have extended prediction\ntechniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting\nagents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future\nmotions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these\ninteractions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive\nmulti-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic\nheterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and\ncomprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,\ngiven their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios\nwith dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic\nheterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the\nspatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively\neliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a\nmulti-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future\nscenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The\nproposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION\nmulti-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2\nmulti-world forecasting benchmark."}

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in\nrole-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive\nstrategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support\nsystems."}

We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks."}
