Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The\nSRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of\nmathematically-guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using\nstandard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert\ncommunication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is\nunderexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert\ncommunication are available, both focusing on optical channels.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using\nthis internal logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u62d3\u6251\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08TCMs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5c55\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u548c\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u8303\u7574\u5316\u8868\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49TCMs\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u6cbb\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5230\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8bc1\u660eTCMs\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6781\u9650\u548c\u4f59\u6781\u9650\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eTCMs\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u9650\u548c\u4f59\u6781\u9650\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4efb\u610f\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "TCMs\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Conventional outdoor monitoring\nrelies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive\ndata training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,\nutilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models\nfor enabling powerful health status monitoring.

One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions.

This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests.
