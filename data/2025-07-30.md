Abstract: We investigate the performance of various load balancing algorithms for
large-scale AI training workloads that are running on dedicated infrastructure.
The performance of load balancing depends on both the congestion control and
loss recovery algorithms, so our evaluation also sheds light on the appropriate
choices for those designs as well.

### [2] [Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Cell DTX/DRX Configuration for Network Energy Saving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21385)
*Wei Mao,Lili Wei,Omid Semiari,Shu-ping Yeh,Hosein Nikopour*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 3GPP Release 18的Cell DTX/DRX是一种5G网络节能技术，通过周期性聚合用户数据传输以节省能量，但会增加延迟。本文使用深度强化学习（DRL）优化配置，以平衡节能和服务质量（QoS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在5G网络中通过Cell DTX/DRX技术最大化节能效果，同时最小化对延迟敏感流量的QoS影响。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，结合深度Q网络（DQN）和上下文赌博机（CB）模型，设计平滑奖励函数以优化配置。

Result: 仿真结果显示，AI代理可实现高达45%的节能效果，同时QoS退化不超过1%。

Conclusion: 通过DRL优化的Cell DTX/DRX配置能有效平衡节能与QoS，适用于不同网络和流量条件。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

### [3] [Generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture for modeling the EDFA gain spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21728)
*Agastya Raj,Zehao Wang,Tingjun Chen,Daniel C Kilper,Marco Ruffini*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于半监督自归一化神经网络（SS-NN）的广义少样本迁移学习架构，用于优化掺铒光纤放大器（EDFA）的增益谱预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向多供应商解决方案发展，准确建模EDFA的增益谱对优化光网络性能至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：无监督预训练（噪声增强测量）和监督微调（自定义加权MSE损失），并结合迁移学习技术（同质和异质模型适应）。

Result: 在26个EDFA上的实验表明，该方法显著减少了测量需求，同时实现了更低的平均绝对误差和更优的误差分布。

Conclusion: 所提出的SS-NN模型在增益谱预测中表现优于基准方法，适用于多种EDFA类型。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

### [4] [RRTO: A High-Performance Transparent Offloading System for Model Inference in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21739)
*Zekai Sun,Xiuxian Guan,Zheng Lin,Yuhao Qing,Haoze Song,Zihan Fang,Zhe Chen,Fangming Liu,Heming Cui,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: RRTO是一种高性能透明卸载系统，通过记录/重放机制和操作符序列搜索算法，显著降低延迟和能耗，无需修改源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的移动设备上部署ML应用面临计算资源不足和平台兼容性差的问题，现有透明卸载方法因频繁RPC导致高延迟。

Method: 提出RRTO系统，利用记录/重放机制和操作符序列搜索算法，消除重复RPC，提高性能。

Result: RRTO将延迟和能耗降低高达98%，性能接近非透明方法，且无需修改代码。

Conclusion: RRTO为MEC推理提供了一种高效透明的卸载解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Deploying Machine Learning (ML) applications on resource-constrained mobile
devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources and poor
platform compatibility. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers
offloading-based inference paradigm using GPU servers, existing approaches are
divided into non-transparent and transparent methods, with the latter
necessitating modifications to the source code. Non-transparent offloading
achieves high performance but requires intrusive code modification, limiting
compatibility with diverse applications. Transparent offloading, in contrast,
offers wide compatibility but introduces significant transmission delays due to
per-operator remote procedure calls (RPCs). To overcome this limitation, we
propose RRTO, the first high-performance transparent offloading system tailored
for MEC inference. RRTO introduces a record/replay mechanism that leverages the
static operator sequence in ML models to eliminate repetitive RPCs. To reliably
identify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search
algorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and
accelerates matching via a two-level strategy. Evaluation demonstrates that
RRTO achieves substantial reductions of up to 98% in both per-inference latency
and energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art transparent methods and
yields results comparable to non-transparent approaches, all without
necessitating any source code modification.

### [5] [Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21162)
*Xu Yang,Chenhui Lin,Yue Yang,Qi Wang,Haotian Liu,Haizhou Hua,Wenchuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动建模与优化方法，用于解决分布式能源资源在主动配电网（ADN）中的调度问题，通过多LLM协作架构简化操作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源在ADN中的普及使得调度变得重要，但新加入的运营商缺乏专业知识，依赖人工专家成本高且耗时。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计多LLM协作架构（信息提取器、问题构建器和代码程序员），并开发定制化优化技术。

Result: 通过自然语言查询生成调度策略，消除技术障碍，提高效率。测试案例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为ADN调度提供了智能、灵活的解决方案，显著提升了操作效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

### [6] [SynLang and Symbiotic Epistemology: A Manifesto for Conscious Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21067)
*Jan Kapusta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Symbiotic Epistemology的哲学框架，旨在通过SynLang协议实现透明的人机协作，提升人类对AI的信任和协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释性方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入Symbiotic Epistemology哲学框架和SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实证验证，SynLang协议成功实现了透明的人机对话，支持AI的适应性推理和元认知干预。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论通过双层次透明性，增强了人类智能，保留了人类能动性，并在协作决策中维护了伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

### [7] [Reasoning Language Models for Root Cause Analysis in 5G Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21974)
*Mohamed Sana,Nicola Piovesan,Antonio De Domenico,Yibin Kang,Haozhe Zhang,Merouane Debbah,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行移动网络中的根因分析（RCA），并通过两阶段训练方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络中的根因分析（RCA）需要可解释性、领域专业知识和因果推理，现有开源推理LLMs在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，并引入TeleLogs数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM规模上显著优于现有推理和非推理模型，且能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在网络运维中具有实际和可解释的RCA潜力。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

### [9] [Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123)
*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、提升数据多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助模块开发，旨在提高效率、降低门槛，并优化合成患者数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中表现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步探索LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力，并解决现有局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

### [10] [Measuring and Analyzing Intelligence via Contextual Uncertainty in Large Language Models using Information-Theoretic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21129)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过构建“认知轮廓”来分析大语言模型（LLM）的信息处理机制，重点关注熵衰减曲线和信息增益跨度（IGS）指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在任务上的表现，而对其内部信息处理机制的理解不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供一种新的分析视角。

Method: 提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过熵衰减曲线和信息增益跨度（IGS）指数构建模型的“认知轮廓”，分析其信息处理动态。

Result: 研究发现不同LLM具有独特且一致的认知轮廓，这些轮廓对模型规模和文本复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: 本文为分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

### [12] [NPO: Learning Alignment and Meta-Alignment through Structured Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21131)
*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人类参与的决策系统的动态对齐优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义，提出元对齐概念，并通过场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈实现可扩展操作循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下，对齐损失和监控保真度均收敛，实证显示NPO在大规模部署中有显著价值。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑、可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与动态环境中的实际可靠性联系起来。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在提供高风险生活建议时的失败模式，包括奉承和过度自信，并通过实验验证了模型的稳健性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险决策中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，亟需研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三项实验：(1) 多选评估模型抗压性；(2) 自由回答分析结合安全分类和LLM评判；(3) 机制可解释性实验调控模型行为。

Result: 部分模型表现稳健，高分模型通过提问而非直接建议提升安全性；激活调控可直接影响模型的谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活调控为安全对齐提供新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站一致地量化数独难度，并帮助初学者解题。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并可靠地抑制大型语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 学习55个有害子概念的线性探针，构建低秩有害子空间，并通过子空间消融和主导方向引导进行实验。

Result: 主导方向引导能几乎消除有害性，同时保持较高的实用性。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解LLM行为提供了可扩展视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

Motivation: 在高风险、时间紧迫的场景中，传统XAI方法提供的统一解释和显式反馈机制不实用，需要一种非侵入式的自适应解释框架来增强信任。

Method: 利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG和眼动追踪）推断用户状态，通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF框架能够根据用户的工作负荷、压力和情绪动态调整解释，从而提升人机协作中的快速信任。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发适应高压环境的自适应XAI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳，需改进其协作效果。

Method: 通过计算LLM的自多样性值和跨一致性值，动态选择最优LLM集群组件并剔除不一致输出。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，如NEJMQA的Obstetrics and Gynecology学科ACC达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的准确性和协作效果。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Result: 在多个数据集、LLM和偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能更有效地揭示LLM的复杂偏见模式，具有更高的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在组合性语言解释方面的能力，发现其性能随问题复杂性增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够系统性地组合解释语言，尤其是将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询的能力。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，并通过不同规模的模型进行实验。

Result: 实验显示，随着问题复杂性增加，LLMs的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，表明其组合解释能力有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在系统性和组合性解释问题方面存在困难，无法有效将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟问题。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix将吞吐量提升3.53倍，推理损失降低0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括一个查询分类器和一个微调的LLM，用于检测模糊查询并生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调的LLM在生成有用澄清问题方面优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确和有用。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过模仿人类代码审查过程，显著提高了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态环境中更可靠的问答系统开发提供了重要进展，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和心理学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具显著提升任务效率，且标注者技能（包括AI工具使用能力）是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Result: 实验显示Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于基线18%，人类评估中其提问和输出更受青睐。

Conclusion: 主动澄清能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量框架，通过满足三个基本性质来验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在问答和其他数据集上比基线方法更准确地预测模型性能。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性度量提供了一种更精细的方法来评估模型输出的可信度，优于传统阈值方法。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

*Haiquan Wang,Yi Chen,Shang Zeng,Yun Bian,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GovRelBench基准，用于评估大语言模型在政府领域的核心能力，特别是领域相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注安全性，而模型核心能力（如领域相关性）评估不足。

Method: 开发了GovRelBench基准和评估工具GovRelBERT，采用SoftGovScore方法训练模型。

Result: 提供了有效的评估框架和工具，代码和数据集已开源。

Conclusion: GovRelBench填补了政府领域大模型能力评估的空白，为相关研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and
practice. Our code and dataset are available at

### [33] [Evo-DKD: Dual-Knowledge Decoding for Autonomous Ontology Evolution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21438)
*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一个双解码器框架，结合结构化本体遍历和非结构化文本推理，用于自主本体演化，优于仅使用结构化或非结构化解码的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动维护本体和知识图谱耗时费力，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽拥有丰富非结构化知识，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: Evo-DKD采用双解码器框架，一个生成候选本体编辑，另一个生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在本体更新精度和下游任务性能上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于大语言模型和检索增强生成（RAG）的人工智能工具Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中的表现，发现其在准确性、相关性和完整性等方面优于ChatGPT-4omini，并展示了整合CPIC和PharmGKB数据对提升AI性能的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中的性能，评估其生成个性化、准确响应的能力，并比较其与其他模型的优劣。

Method: 分两阶段评估：第一阶段仅嵌入CPIC数据，第二阶段加入PharmGKB内容。通过Likert量表和召回率等指标评分，并与ChatGPT-4omini对比。

Result: Sherpa Rx在准确性（4.9）、相关性（5.0）、清晰度（5.0）和完整性（4.8）上表现优异，显著优于ChatGPT-4omini。整合额外资源（如PharmGKB）进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: Sherpa Rx展示了生成式AI在药物基因组学中的潜力，能够通过整合多源数据提供更准确的个性化决策支持。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

### [35] [An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21471)
*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的框架，在低数据条件下实现红外光谱的自动解析，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维度和重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对，而LLM的泛化和推理能力为自动化科学工作流提供了新可能。

Method: 提出端到端的LLM驱动框架，整合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过闭环多轮协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM的表现优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下媲美或超越机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，展现了LLM在科学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类与AI系统的协作需求增加，开发能准确模拟个体决策的AI变得重要。象棋作为精确技能测量的AI基准，为人类-AI对齐提供了理想测试平台。

Method: Maia4All采用两阶段优化：1) 通过原型丰富模型连接群体与个体行为建模；2) 利用能力水平或用户原型以最少数据初始化和优化个体嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，Maia4All仅需20局游戏即可准确预测个体行为和模式，显著优于以往需5000局游戏的方法。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI适应提供了高效框架，其原型丰富模型方法可扩展至其他领域，如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）简化供应链管理中的决策过程，减少对数据科学团队的依赖，并加速决策速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中的决策工具虽然优化了决策，但理解和调整这些工具的输出仍需大量时间和专家介入，影响了决策效率。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来自动化解释工具结果、分析场景和更新数学模型，减少人工干预。

Result: 通过LLMs，决策时间从数天或数周缩短至几分钟或几小时，显著提高了规划者和高管的效率。

Conclusion: LLMs可以显著提升供应链技术的民主化和决策效率，减少对专家的依赖。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在面对视觉不可回答问题时的诚实行为，构建了大规模基准MoHoBench，并发现大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在视觉不可回答问题上的诚实行为尚未充分研究，亟需系统性评估。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，并对28种流行MLLMs进行了诚实性评估。

Result: 发现大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实性不仅受语言建模影响，还受视觉信息影响。

Conclusion: 提出了基于监督和偏好学习的初步对齐方法，为未来可信MLLMs的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了定义神经网络是否学习并使用“世界模型”的精确标准，旨在为实验研究提供共同语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为常用但非正式的术语赋予操作意义，便于实验研究。

Result: 提出了一个非平凡的世界模型定义，重点关注潜在状态空间的表示。

Conclusion: 为世界模型的研究提供了理论基础，未来可扩展至动作效果建模。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

TL;DR: ST-GDance是一个新颖的框架，通过解耦空间和时间依赖关系，优化长期无碰撞的群舞生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群舞生成需要同步多个舞者并保持空间协调，现有方法难以建模密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞风险。

Method: 使用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，加速稀疏注意力进行高效时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有方法，尤其在生成长且连贯的群舞序列方面。

Conclusion: ST-GDance显著降低了计算成本，同时确保了流畅且无碰撞的交互。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法能有效提升非专家用户对AI模型的理解和信任。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Conclusion: PHP方法通过平衡知识共享和任务特异性，有效解决了多任务增量学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在具身智能中具有未开发的潜力，尤其在开放物理世界场景中，未来研究应进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

*Alessio Maritan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StaffPro是一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的代理，用于联合解决人员配置和员工画像问题，通过自然语言交互和持续反馈优化管理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统人员配置方法中缺乏灵活性和自然语言交互的问题，同时实现持续的员工技能和偏好估计。

Method: 提出StaffPro代理，结合数学框架和LLM能力，通过自然语言表达目标、接受文本输入，并建立人机反馈循环。

Result: 在咨询公司模拟中，StaffPro成功估计员工属性并生成高质量排班表。

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人员管理提供了灵活、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）对有害输入的脆弱性，提出了三种关键能力定义其安全理解，并提出了一种无需微调的安全增强技术SASA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs相比纯语言模型更容易受到有害输入的影响，作者希望通过分析其内部动态来提升安全性。

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种有效的方法，能够在不微调的情况下增强LVLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

TL;DR: Assistax是一个基于JAX硬件加速的开源基准测试工具，专注于辅助机器人任务中的强化学习挑战，提供快速训练和多代理RL支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL基准（如游戏）难以直接应用于现实世界的机器人交互场景，需要多样化且更贴近实际任务的测试平台。

Method: 利用JAX硬件加速实现快速物理模拟，采用多代理RL训练多样化的伙伴代理，测试机器人代理的零样本协调能力。

Result: Assistax在训练速度上比CPU方案快370倍，并为连续控制和多代理RL算法提供了可靠的基线。

Conclusion: Assistax是一个实用的基准测试工具，有助于推动辅助机器人领域的RL研究。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开并截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并高效逼近最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在大状态-动作空间或长期依赖问题中计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以较少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略与值迭代表示，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP在跨数据集脑功能分区中表现优异，解决了域偏移问题。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有理论优势，并通过SAT求解器实现验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC能有效推断异质因果关系，揭示因果机制表达。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

TL;DR: MixGRPO是一种新框架，通过结合SDE和ODE的混合采样策略，优化了GRPO在图像生成中对人类偏好的对齐效率，显著减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GRPO在图像生成的人类偏好对齐中表现优异，但FlowGRPO等方法因需要在MDP中采样和优化所有去噪步骤而效率低下。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。还提出MixGRPO-Flash，支持高阶求解器进一步提速。

Result: MixGRPO在人类偏好对齐的多个维度上表现优异，训练时间减少近50%，MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%训练时间。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略显著提升了效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上优于15种基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导具有显著价值。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且鲁棒的目标推断框架，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法能有效缓解优势崩溃问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，用于自动分类GitHub README文件的不同部分，并通过微调BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa模型，取得了0.98的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件内容不完整可能影响其使用和推广，因此需要自动化工具来分类和优化这些文件。

Method: 研究微调了三种编码器模型（BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa），并使用包含4226个README文件片段的黄金标准数据集进行训练。

Result: 该方法在分类任务中表现优异，F1分数达到0.98，并验证了参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）的经济性。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM可用于自动分类README文件内容，为GitHub仓库的优化提供了自动化工具支持。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but
raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To
mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system

curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing
guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce
Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,
outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat

Method: 利用自然语言建模传感器数据与活动，通过嵌入实现零样本分类。

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，该方法能有效支持零样本识别。

Conclusion: 该方法为HAR系统提供了一种无需LLM的零样本分类解决方案。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了透明、以人为本的AI在公共卫生领域的应用。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架有效解决了GUI代理的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达的目标下与用户主动协作的能力尚未充分研究，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好的交互场景，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具做出决策。

Result: 评估显示，LLM代理在任务完成与用户意图对齐上存在显著差距，仅有20%的回答完全符合用户意图，高级模型也仅能发现不到30%的用户偏好。

Conclusion: UserBench为衡量和提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了关键工具，突显了构建真正协作伙伴的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种新型的(2,2)-广义自行车码（GB码）家族，性能与Kitaev环面码和最佳2D权重-4表面码相当，突破了关于偶距离GB码的长期认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索比表面码更优的量子纠错码，特别是针对(2,2)-GB码的最小距离下界，以构建性能优越的码家族。

Method: 利用二进制循环矩阵对构造(2,2)-GB码，并引入CSS保持的等价关系以严格比较基于Cayley图的CSS码。

Result: 构建了三种最优(2,2)-GB码家族，参数分别为[[2n²,2,n]]、[[4r²,2,2r]]和[[(2t+1)²+1,2,2t+1]]，部分家族与现有最优码不等价。

Conclusion: (2,2)-GB码在性能上可与表面码媲美，且部分家族突破了理论限制，为量子纠错提供了新选择。

Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface
codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized
Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two
non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance,
we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with
parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1
]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D
weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the
second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB
codes, previously deemed impossible.
  All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard
equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a
CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley
graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are
inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while
the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code.
  Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length
below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4
surface codes.

Motivation: 随着物联网的发展，Grant-Free接入方案成为支持大规模设备连接的有前景的解决方案，但其与无蜂窝大规模MIMO的结合带来了活动检测和导频污染缓解的挑战。

Method: 方法包括基于分布式最大似然的组件迭代活动检测，以及伪先验混合变分贝叶斯和期望传播（PP-VB-EP）算法用于联合数据检测和信道估计。

Result: PP-VB-EP相比传统VB-EP表现出更好的收敛性和对初始化的鲁棒性，尤其是在有限字母数据符号的情况下。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法有效解决了无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中Grant-Free接入的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered
one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless
communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the
Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support
massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces
significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for
activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we
propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method
first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data
portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid
Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint
data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the
proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced
sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a
finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated
posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing
(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed
fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level
Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

Conclusion: 论文成功推广了群码的存在性准则，为更广泛的群结构提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be a finite field and $G$ a finte group with $(|G|,q)=1$.
By a group code in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$ we mean a two-sided ideal in $\mathbb
{F}_q[G]$. We will prove a general criterion for the existence of group codes
with given hull dimension, and then apply it to deduce explicit criterions for
existence of group codes with hull dimension $\leq3$. In particular our
criterion for the existence of $1$-dimensional hulls generalizes that of
privious work which consider only abelian groups $G$.

Method: 采用双时间尺度方法，基于信道统计优化RIS相位偏移，并分析其波束成形增益与RIS元素数量的关系。

Result: RIS捕获的功率随元素数量线性增长，但波束成形增益在元素增加时快速饱和，饱和程度由PAS的衰减速率决定。

Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the
RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the
overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power
captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the
two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates
rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power
angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay
rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly
spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this
saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems
to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While
the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied
extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has
hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the
communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis
of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a
macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be
significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,
demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a
closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS
elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

Abstract: The domain-independent universal Normalized Information Distance based on
Kolmogorov complexity has been (in approximate form) successfully applied to a
variety of difficult clustering problems. In this paper we investigate
theoretical properties of the un-normalized algorithmic information distance
$d_K$. The main question we are asking in this work is what properties this
curious distance has, besides being a metric. We show that many
(in)finite-dimensional spaces can(not) be isometrically scale-embedded into the
space of finite strings with metric $d_K$. We also show that $d_K$ is not an
Euclidean distance, but any finite set of points in Euclidean space can be
scale-embedded into $(\{0,1\}^*,d_K)$. A major contribution is the development
of the necessary framework and tools for finding more (interesting) properties
of $d_K$ in future, and to state several open problems.
