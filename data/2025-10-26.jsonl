Leveraging the\nscore-to-Fisher bridge (SFB) methodology, we derive a computationally tractable\nformula for the information gradient that is the gradient of mutual information\nwith respect to the parameters of the nonlinear front-end. Our formula\nexpresses this gradient in terms of two key components: the score function of\nthe marginal output distribution, which can be learned via denoising score\nmatching (DSM), and the Jacobian of the front-end function, which is handled\nefficiently using the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) within automatic\ndifferentiation frameworks. This enables practical parameter optimization\nthrough gradient ascent. Furthermore, we extend this framework to task-oriented\nscenarios, deriving gradients for both task-specific mutual information, where\na task variable depends on the channel input, and the information bottleneck\n(IB) objective. A key advantage of our approach is that it facilitates\nend-to-end optimization of the nonlinear front-end without requiring explicit\ncomputation on the output distribution. Extensive experimental validation\nconfirms the correctness of our information gradient formula against analytical\nsolutions and demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing both linear and\nnonlinear channels toward their objectives."}
