In practical deployments,\nthe control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks,\nwith configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect,\nwireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to\nsignificant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading\nsystem performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook\nindex assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem,\nequivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are\n\"cities\" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A\nnovel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of\na provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase.

While Autoregressive\nCompression Models (ACMs) have markedly improved compression efficiency through\nprobabilistic prediction, current approaches remain constrained by two critical\nlimitations: suboptimal compression ratios due to insufficient fine-grained\nfeature extraction during probability modeling, and real-time processing\nbottlenecks caused by high resource consumption and low compression speeds. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Efficient Dual-path Parallel Compression\n(EDPC), a hierarchically optimized compression framework that synergistically\nenhances modeling capability and execution efficiency via coordinated dual-path\noperations. At the modeling level, we introduce the Information Flow Refinement\n(IFR) metric grounded in mutual information theory, and design a Multi-path\nByte Refinement Block (MBRB) to strengthen cross-byte dependency modeling via\nheterogeneous feature propagation.

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived. In particular, in the Gaussian case, the model has been analyzed for\nfixed and known channel state. This paper is motivated by the fact that, in\npractice, the channel state is a random process, and it is estimated at the\nbase station side through uplink pilot symbols sent by the users. The pilot\ndimension may take up a large portion of the channel coherence block, i.e., the\nnumber of symbols over which the channel state remains approximately constant.\nHence, sending both pilot and data symbols from the relays to the CP may\nrequire a significant overhead, especially when the fronthaul capacity is\nsmall. As a prototypical problem, we consider the ergodic achievable rate for a\ndiamond network formed by a single user and two relays where the channel state\nis known at the relays, but not known at the CP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u5bb9\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53ca\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u80fd\u5360\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5e72\u5757\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u94bb\u77f3\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u4e0b\u7684\u904d\u5386\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5df2\u77e5\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u4e2d\u592e\u5904\u7406\u5668\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u673a\u4e14\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u904d\u5386\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Simulation results\nshow that our proposed optimization scheme significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity of conventional alternating optimization (AO), while\nachieving communication performance comparable to the AO-based approach and\nsuperior to existing fixed-position/rotation antenna arrays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u76846DMA\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "6DMA\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u5929\u7ebf\u76843D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e/\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a6DMA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This overlooks challenges stemming from\nthe evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize\nand assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen\nentities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an\nincremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to\naddress entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse\nconnections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a\nweighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing\nTKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global\ndefinition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood\nproximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in\ntraining accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link\nprediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves\na 10\\% improvement and a 15\\% boost in MRR for these datasets.

The first part reviews recent\nfindings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,\nincluding Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also\nhighlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true\nunderstanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys\nemerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on\nsystem architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such\nas Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of\ntheir design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.\nParticular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,\ncalibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The\nfinal section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box\nsystems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious\ngames-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or\npredictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches\nthat integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,\nNetlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of\nlanguage-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of\nclassical rule-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\uff1b2) \u8c03\u67e5\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b3) \u533a\u5206\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63d0\u5021\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6216\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06LLMs\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this work, we\nintroduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems\nusing a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.\nWe present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural\nRewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a\nresult of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both\nmodels can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering\nsignificant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and\ninference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the\nsimplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their\nversatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is\ntrained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system\nsignificantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,\na recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic\nproblems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language\nmodels.
