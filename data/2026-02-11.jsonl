Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons. Using this formulation, Tommy produces a partial order of events, achieving significantly better fairness than a Spanner TrueTime-based baseline approach."}

Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.\n  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines."}

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models.

We reinterpret the Fermat equation as an $n$-th moment constraint, constructing a statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}_n$ of generalized normal distributions via the Maximum Entropy Principle. By Chentsov's Theorem, the natural metric is the Fisher information metric ($L^2$); however, the global structure is governed by the $L^n$ moment constraint. This reveals a discrepancy between the local quadratic metric and the global $L^n$ structure. We axiomatically define an \"Information-Geometric Fermat Solution,\" postulating that the lattice structure must maintain \"dual lattice consistency\" under the Legendre transform. We prove the non-existence of such structures for $n \\ge 3$. Through the Poisson Summation Formula and Hausdorff-Young Inequality, we demonstrate that the Fourier transform induces an alteration of the function family ($L^n \\to L^q$, where $1/n + 1/q = 1$), rendering dual lattice consistency analytically impossible.

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications."}

This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%.

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information.

This article presents an extensive, trace-driven analysis of user data traffic (covering five years of observations, six large Internet service providers (covering research, business and consumer category type), twenty autonomous systems, and fourteen countries.\n  Our three primary findings are: i users data packet transmission paths are not deterministic and does not always select the geographically shortest path; ii) user packets take different routes that cover many countries and detour between two fixed points. Even after changing the types of Internet service provider type (e.g., from commercial to research), the routing can differ significantly between two locations. iii) Packet transmission delay can be influenced by changing the Internet service provider and IP protocol versions (i.e., from IPv4 to IPv6)."}

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets."}

To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \\log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment."}

However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios."}

In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices.

We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors.

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments."}

At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning.

To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning.

Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs."}

In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes.

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks."}

The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application."}

Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice."}

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited."}

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA."}

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets."}

We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization. These results highlight early stopping as a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs."}

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning."}

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks."}
