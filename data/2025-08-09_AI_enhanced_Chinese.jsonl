A common approach to get\ninformation molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;\nhowever, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental\nmolecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are\nidentical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as\nmolecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that\nharvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two\nreservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer\nthem between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores\nenergy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through\ntheoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for\nmoving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring\nhigher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while\nusing fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings\nprovide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient\nmolecule transfer techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u5206\u5b50\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u5206\u79bb\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982MoSK\uff09\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u5206\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6d53\u5ea6\u76f8\u540c\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u6536\u96c6\u5206\u5b50\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u4e24\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d88\u8017\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u5b50\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8f6c\u79fb\u521d\u59cb\u6d53\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8f6c\u79fb\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u5206\u5b50\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications.

Therefore, a reliable leakage estimator\nis essential. Neural network-based estimators provide a data-driven way to\nestimate mutual information without requiring full knowledge of the channel or\nsource distributions. In this work, we aim to scale the blocklength of a\nwiretap code such that the estimator can still feasibly operate. We propose an\nimproved mutual information estimator based on the variational contrastive\nlog-ration upper bound framework, tailored for both discrete and continuous\nvariables. By using a mixture of Bernoulli experts parameterized by neural\nnetworks, the estimator is able to quantify information leakage in\ncommunication systems, which employ complex data processing like universal hash\nfamily. We further propose a method to utilize the proposed estimator to design\nthe universal hash family for a wiretap code or secret key generation design.\nSimulation results show thatprior methods significantly underestimate the\nmutual information, particularly when using universal hash family for higher\nblocklengths ($n\\gg$16). The proposed method can scale the blocklength up to\n255, and we conjecture that the design can scale well to even higher\nblocklengths given adequate training data and model size.

We introduce a new research direction guided by\nbrain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect\ninputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We\nfine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)\nusing RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their\nperformance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL\nfine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance\ndeclines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical\nlimitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a\nscenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave\nthese reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the\nreasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the\nimportance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios.

To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic\nframework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game\ncalled the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand\nplayer and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve\nthis game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which\nalternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,\nthe players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's\nstructural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple\niterations.

Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our\nframework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA\nand BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement\nto human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,\nrespectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This\ndemonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation\nframework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709Agent-as-a-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAIA\u548cBigCodeBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Judge Agent\u6bd4GPT-4o\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad84.76%\u548c10.52%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}
