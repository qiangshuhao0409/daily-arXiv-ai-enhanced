To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI\nmodel caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability,\nstemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a\nshared pre-trained model with frozen parameters.

As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment.

Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed\nmodels, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the\nupdated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of\neach ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which\nindirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process,\nmaking it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments.

In this work, we investigate a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled data collection\nand wireless power transfer system in LAWN.

FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):\nmachine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through\nsemantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and\nlimitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic\nrouting that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing\noperational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task\ndecomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks\ninto DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering\nthat groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for\nk-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe\nsemantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity\nthrough hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.\nEvaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,\nwith clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex\nreasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives.

Real-world deployments of lane-change\nprediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the\npractical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often\nunder-documented.

Promising unprecedented speed and\nthe ability to learn from real-world data, it offers a real alternative to\nconventional deep learning (DL) models. However, no experimental evaluation on\nproduction-grade networks has yet validated its assumed scalability or\npractical benefits. This leaves mobile network operators (MNOs) and the\nresearch community without clear guidance on its applicability. In this paper,\nwe fill this gap by employing both differentiable ray tracing and DL models to\nemulate radio coverage using extensive real-world data collected from the\nnetwork of a major MNO, covering 13 cities and more than 10,000 antennas. Our\nresults show that, while differentiable ray-tracing simulators have contributed\nto reducing the efficiency-accuracy gap, they struggle to generalize from\nreal-world data at a large scale, and they remain unsuitable for real-time\napplications. In contrast, DL models demonstrate higher accuracy and faster\nadaptation than differentiable ray-tracing simulators across urban, suburban,\nand rural deployments, achieving accuracy gains of up to 3 dB. Our experimental\nresults aim to provide timely insights into a fundamental open question with\ndirect implications on the wireless ecosystem and future research."}

By proactively caching\nmodels at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency\nfor on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI\nmodels poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage\ncapacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over\nwireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI\nmodel caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability,\nstemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a\nshared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches\nmodel parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of\nreusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it\nincorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously\ndeliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum\nutilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay\nminimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge\nnodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we\ndevelop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to\nexplicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating\ncooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to\nadaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model,\nboosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical\nanalysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence\nperformance of the proposed learning framework."}

We focus on a typical\nmulti-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge\nservers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that\nclients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple\nESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed\nmodels, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the\nupdated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of\neach ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which\nindirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process,\nmaking it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments. Extensive\nexperimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared\nto existing methods."}

This paper introduces a lightweight, modular mobile data augmentation\nframework designed to enhance multi-cell fingerprinting-based positioning using\noperator-collected minimization of drive test (MDT) records. The proposed\napproach decouples spatial and radio-feature synthesis: kernel density\nestimation (KDE) models the empirical spatial distribution to generate\ngeographically coherent synthetic locations, while a k-nearest-neighbor\n(KNN)-based block produces augmented per-cell radio fingerprints.

We both validate each augmentation module independently and assess\nits end-to-end impact on fingerprinting-based positioning using a real-world\nMDT dataset provided by an Italian mobile network operator across diverse urban\nand peri-urban scenarios.
