This paper presents the design and implementation of\nNetReplica, a system that addresses this challenge by generating training\ndatasets with two critical properties: realism in protocol dynamics and\ncontrollability of network conditions. NetReplica models networks as\ncollections of bottleneck links with specific attributes, achieves realism by\nleveraging production network traces, and enables controllability through fine\ngrained control knobs for each link attribute. Our evaluation using Puffer\ndemonstrates that NetReplica not only matches existing data characteristics but\ngenerates realistic samples that are underrepresented in or absent from Puffer\ndata. Models trained on NetReplica augmented datasets show substantially\nimproved generalizability, reducing transmission time prediction error by up to\n47% for challenging network conditions compared to models trained solely on\nPuffer data.

The performance\nof both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of\naccurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks,\nuplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference\nsignal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base\nstation implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information\nstreams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby\nincreasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to\nmore users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching\nand compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS\nand SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a\nreal-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently\nuncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing\nopportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS\nsignificantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE)\nof 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of\nusers as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance. By\nopportunistically combining DMRS and SRS, CARTS therefore provides a practical,\nstandard-compliant solution to improve CSI availability for ISAC without\nrequiring additional radio resources."}

To address this, we introduce Alternating Topology and Routing\nOptimization (ATRO), a solver-free framework that alternates between TO and\nrouting optimization (RO). This decomposition exploits two key insights: first,\neach alternating update step monotonically reduces maximum link utilization\n(MLU), ensuring consistent performance improvement across iterations; second,\nthe TO subproblem, equivalent to one-hop optimization, exhibits a monotonic\nstructure that enables optimal solutions via an efficient Accelerated Binary\nSearch Method (ABSM).

However,\ntransferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary\nenvironments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer\nmethods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly\nretraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals."}
