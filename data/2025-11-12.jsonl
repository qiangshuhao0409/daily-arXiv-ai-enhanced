We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability."}

Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the \"win-win\" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks."}

However, this paradigm poses multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the devices at the edge of the network, their limited computational, communication, and energy capacities, as well as their different sensing and actuating capabilities. To address these issues, we propose an optimal scheduling approach to minimize the overall latency of a workflow application in an edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical system. We consider multiple edge devices cooperating with a hub device and a cloud server. All devices feature heterogeneous multicore processors and various sensing, actuating, or other specialized capabilities. We present a comprehensive formulation based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming, encapsulating multiple constraints often overlooked by existing approaches. We conduct a comparative experimental evaluation between our method and a well-established and effective scheduling heuristic, which we enhanced to consider the constraints of the specific problem. The results reveal that our technique outperforms the heuristic, achieving an average latency improvement of 13.54% in a relevant real-world use case, under varied system configurations.

Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding."}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks."}

Ensuring their correctness before deployment is thus critical for reliability. While prior verification frameworks can efficiently detect bugs for programs running on a single switch, they overlook the common interactive behaviors in distributed settings, thereby missing related bugs that can cause state inconsistencies and system failures. This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems. It also reduces verification time by up to 913.2x and memory consumption by up to 1.9x compared to the state-of-the-art verifier."}

SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems."}

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice. To eliminate the need for the prior information, we propose a threshold estimation method using the received samples. Numerical results indicate that under IQ imbalance, directly using the existing method leads to a significant degradation in BER performance. However, this degradation can be effectively mitigated by our derived detection threshold."}

We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so.

We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco.

Our model detects disrupted RUs due to cascading failures, reacts by re-instantiating CU and DU in alternative cloud locations, and recovers service continuity by reestablishing functional chains.

To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure.

Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late."}

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training."}

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers."}

Includes 7 pages of supplementary material", "summary": "Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod."}

The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity.

To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment."}

Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency."}

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment."}

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs."}

How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks."}

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability."}

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs."}

Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge.

By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption.

Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture."}

However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing."}

Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice."}

This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case.

To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach."}

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning."}

This paper presents a structured framework for developing safe datasets aligned with ISO/PAS 8800 guidelines. Using AI-based perception systems as the primary use case, it introduces the AI Data Flywheel and the dataset lifecycle, covering data collection, annotation, curation, and maintenance. The framework incorporates rigorous safety analyses to identify hazards and mitigate risks caused by dataset insufficiencies. It also defines processes for establishing dataset safety requirements and proposes verification and validation strategies to ensure compliance with safety standards. In addition to outlining best practices, the paper reviews recent research and emerging trends in dataset safety and autonomous vehicle development, providing insights into current challenges and future directions. By integrating these perspectives, the paper aims to advance robust, safety-assured AI systems for autonomous driving applications."}

While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This \"patch\" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be \"patched\" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases."}

Collins"], "title": "A Matter of Interest: Understanding Interestingness of Math Problems in Humans and Language Models", "comment": "Published at the Math-AI Workshop, NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships."}

The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding."}

While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible."}

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the \"win-win\" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks."}
