In this paper, we aim to resolve\nthis issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based\ngrant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum\na posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation\nproblems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based\nalgorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both\nproposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the\npilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we\nanalyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square\nerror (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC\nhas the lower computational complexity (in dominant term). Finally, numerical\nresults show the two proposed AMP-based algorithms' superior performance and\nrespective preferable regions, revealing their significant values for\nOFDM-based grant-free access."}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information\ntransmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional\nreinforcement learning methods."}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply\ncontext to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use\nabilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive\ndatasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse\nformats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the\ndifficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks\nwith high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the\nsuccess rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across\ndifferent MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the\nnumber of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the\ntextual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an\nLLM to process all at once.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information\ntransmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional\nreinforcement learning methods."}

However, existing approaches often rely on\nstatic templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to\ndiverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural\nlanguage-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning\n(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables\nrapid subtask-level adaptation.

Most existing research focuses on\ncombining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world\nscenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or\norganizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate\nelements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in\npattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves\nZadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness."}

To enable\npractical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,\nan unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any\nattack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,\nwe establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,\nand global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive\nunderstanding for malicious agent detection.
