Our analysis reveals\nthat puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments\", ``length-scaling'' and entropy\ndynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning\nhierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from\nlow-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling\ntwo-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness\nand must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively\nshifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of\nhigh-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in\nprevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure\nagnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens.

Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,\nReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,\ntask-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning\nbased alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial\nparameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion\n(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a\nstructured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at\ninference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding\nand hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable\ncorrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain\nconstraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the\nadaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,\npresent algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a\ntext-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in\nthe provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the\nsupplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further\nimproves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss\nscalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and\nmulti?agent extensions."}

To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,\na novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete\ntoken-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,\nreasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise\nperspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an\noptimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off\nbetween underfitting and overfitting.

In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN\n(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit\nbluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed\nan experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while\nwe log their actions.

In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other.
