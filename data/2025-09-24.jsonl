Existing models\nfor predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive\naccuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are\nfurther challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise\nonly a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to\ntheory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final\nclassifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their\ninteraction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode\nchoice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing\nchoice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.\nThis study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode\nchoices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various\napplications."}

Misclassification can halt\nshipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the\nU.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark\nfor HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online\nSearch System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned\nAtlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit\nclassifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements\nof 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.\nBeyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and\neight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to\nguarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While\nAtlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with\nonly 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim\nto position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite\nfuture work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment."}

We first employ a well-designed cold-start\ntraining strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and\nequips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.\nThen, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples\noptimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and\nsubsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly\nPareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic\nORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL\nframework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over\nsynchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,\nLongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional\nefficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%\n(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy.
