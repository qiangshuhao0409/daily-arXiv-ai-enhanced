To further advance the\nestimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel\nestimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a\nFourier neural operator (FNO).

However, choosing between planar\nand spherical models remains challenging. Planar models neglect Earth's\ncurvature, causing deviations in high-altitude NTN analysis, yet are still\noften used for simplicity. This paper introduces relative error to quantify the\ngap between planar and spherical models, helping determine when planar modeling\nis sufficient. To calculate the relative error, we first propose a point\nprocess (PP) generation algorithm that simultaneously generates a pair of\nhomogeneous and asymptotically similar planar and spherical PPs. We then\nintroduce several typical similarity metrics, including topology-related and\nnetwork-level metrics, and further develop a relative error estimation\nalgorithm based on these metrics. In addition, we derive an analytical\nexpression for the optimal planar altitude, which reduces computational\ncomplexity and provides theoretical support for planar approximation.

To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques\nare commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite\ngrowing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on\nprotocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the\nfundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.

They are often biased,\nunreliable, and unfit to define \"ground truth.\" Yet, given the surging need to\nproduce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,\ntraditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain\ncentral to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone.

While deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has\nemerged as a promising technique, its practical application to the complex\nsatellite environment remains an open question. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive DJSCC framework tailored for satellite communications. We first\nestablish a basic system, DJSCC-SAT, and integrate a realistic, multi-state\nstatistical channel model to guide its training and evaluation. To overcome the\nimpracticality of using separate models for every channel condition, we then\nintroduce an adaptable architecture, ADJSCC-SAT, which leverages attention\nmodules to allow a single neural network to adjust to a wide range of channel\nstates with minimal overhead. Through extensive evaluation on Sentinel-2\nmulti-spectral data, we demonstrate that our adaptable approach achieves\nperformance comparable to using multiple specialized networks while\nsignificantly reducing model storage requirements. Furthermore, the adaptable\nmodel shows enhanced robustness to channel estimation errors, outperforming the\nnon-adaptable baseline.

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.
