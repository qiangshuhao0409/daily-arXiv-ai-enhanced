Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient multi-radio microwave and IAB-based FWA framework for rural area connectivity. When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul. The formulated optimization problems aim to minimize the energy consumption of long-haul microwave and multi-hop IAB-based network while satisfying data rate constraints. These problems are solved using dual decomposition and multi-convex programming, supported by dynamic programming.

Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks. Central to their operation is the authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, the single source of truth that maps government domain names to service endpoints. While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u653f\u5e9c\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8fd0\u884c\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d", "motivation": "\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u56fd\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5176\u6743\u5a01DNS\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u540d\u79f0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u6258\u7ba1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u5f81DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u548cDNS\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u53d1\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u97e7\u6027\u5c5e\u6027", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u5e9c\u57df\u540d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u56fd\u5728\u6743\u5a01DNS\u97e7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u5b9e\u8df5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u653f\u5e9c\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u5a01DNS\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5173\u952e\u56fd\u5bb6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u652f\u6301"}}

These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u6108\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd53.84%", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e2d\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u91cf\u7a81\u53d1\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u70ed\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u8fdd\u53cdIEC 61850\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5ef6\u8fdf/\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u98ce\u673a\u505c\u673a\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0", "method": "\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u6108\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e91\u57fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534753.84%\uff1b\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf13.1%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd521.5%\uff1b\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u542f\u52a8\u673a\u67b6\u51b7\u5374\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u5f39\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f"}}

Heath"], "title": "Symbol Distributions in Semantic Communications: A Source-Channel Equilibrium Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \\emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b26\u53f7\u5448\u73b0\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u5c0f\u6709\u6548\u7801\u957f\uff08\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u4e3a\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u53d8\u957f\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u71b5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u6e90\u4e8e\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u8be5\u6743\u8861\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MIMO-OFDM\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b00.68\u7c73\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u548c3.3%\u6ce2\u675f\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eNLOS\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u51c6\u955c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcCSI-\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b2) \u9488\u5bf9\u76f4\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03AP\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7684CRLB\u6e10\u8fd1\u6d88\u5931\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u533a\u5206LOS/NLOS\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee0.68\u7c73\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee3.3%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u76f2\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f2\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We also investigate a single-cluster scenario. All the derived expressions are validated through extensive particle-based simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key parameters, such as the mean number of NMs per cluster, the density of the cluster, and the spatial spread, on the detection performance.

This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find.

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eO-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534719.8%\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7RIC\u6a21\u5757\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d7MAML\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8d1f\u8d23\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u5207\u7247\u5185\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfRL\u548c\u5143RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534719.8%\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728eMBB\u3001URLLC\u548cmMTC\u5207\u7247\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8QoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff1b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534740%\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86O-RAN\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf-\u5728\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3MU-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dCSI\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u7edf\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8bef\u5dee\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "1) \u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u4eabDNN\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7ef4\u62a4\u591a\u4e2a\u5143\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u79bb\u7ebf-\u5728\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agile-AFDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce2\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u8f93\u5757\u7684chirp\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u7387\u6548\u7387\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u9759\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002\u4f20\u7edfAFDM\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176chirp\u53c2\u6570\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u9759\u6001\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgile-AFDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06chirp\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u8f93\u5757\u7684\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6ce2\u5f62\u80fd\u591f\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316PAPR\u3001\u6291\u5236ICI\u6216\u964d\u4f4eCRLB\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgile-AFDM\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfOFDM\u548c\u9759\u6001AFDM\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u529f\u7387\u6548\u7387\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "Agile-AFDM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u3001\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u6ce2\u5f62\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7684\u654f\u6377\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590dLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RLHF\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7b49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u6301\u7eed\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4fee\u590dLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684AI\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3aLLM\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u3002"}}

As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices.

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness.

We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction.

Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts.

We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \\emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoLattice\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7a0b\u5e8f/\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u4e0d\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u5f0f\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u53ea\u7ef4\u62a4\u5355\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\u3001\u906d\u53d7\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u63a2\u7d22\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "EvoLattice\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6574\u4e2a\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e2a\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5019\u9009\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u8def\u5f84\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u3001\u91cd\u7ec4\u548c\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEvoLattice\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524dLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf-\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u5907\u9009\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u6863\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoLattice\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u6574\u4e2a\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u5f0f\u7a81\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%).

A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflCtrl\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236LLM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1133.6%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReflCtrl\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53cd\u601d\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53cd\u601d\u662f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u6700\u591a33.6%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff1b(2) \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTop-p MoE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684Top-p\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u548cTop-k\u8def\u7531\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Top-k\u8def\u7531\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709Top-p\u8def\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTop-p MoE\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u79ef\u5206\uff08PI\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTop-p consistently\u4f18\u4e8eTop-k\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90", "conclusion": "DTop-p\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6"}}

While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f3020\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cQwen-4B\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46PySpark\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u519c\u573a\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u519c\u573a\u786c\u4ef6\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "1) \u5728HuggingFace\u4e0a\u7b5b\u900920\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b5\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6587\u732e\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u641c\u7d22\u3001SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001NoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff1b3) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u75285\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u752830\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b5\u4e2a\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "Qwen-4B\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u8fc7PySpark\u8fdb\u884cNoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\u5f15\u64ce\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5976\u725b\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387"}}

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoutingGen\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u7528few-shot\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7528Intention Chain-of-Thought\uff08ICoT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1146.37%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CoT\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\uff1b2\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5168\u5c40\u95ee\u9898\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u539f\u5219\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u53ea\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoutingGen\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u7528few-shot\u63d0\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u7528Intention Chain-of-Thought\uff08ICoT\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\u610f\u56fe\uff08\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRoutingGen\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1146.37%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002ICoT\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u516d\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RoutingGen\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation.

To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods.

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

Jones"], "title": "Georeferencing complex relative locality descriptions with large language models", "comment": "Provisionally accepted for publication in the International Journal of Geographical Information Science", "summary": "Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages.

We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD.

This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions.

Code available at https://github.com/RenYukun1563/specfem-mcp", "summary": "To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faContext-Picker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u8f6c\u5411\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cf\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8fc7\u5c11\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fc7\u591a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u964d\u4f4e\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9aTop-K\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6bb5\u843d\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5c11\u91cf\u5177\u4f53\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContext-Picker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u53ec\u56de\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u79ef\u6781\u526a\u679d\u5197\u4f59\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u7d27\u51d1\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7ba1\u9053\uff08Leave-One-Out\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\u6316\u6398\"\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u96c6\"\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContext-Picker\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u7406\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u90fd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "Context-Picker\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u8f6c\u5411\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7ba1\u9053\u662f\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains.

Experimental results show that SMMT maintains competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing training time, memory usage, and energy consumption compared to dense attention baselines, demonstrating its suitability as a resource-aware architectural component for scalable intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMMT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728ADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u805a\u7c7b\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSMMT\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "SMMT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study \\emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes.

Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation.
