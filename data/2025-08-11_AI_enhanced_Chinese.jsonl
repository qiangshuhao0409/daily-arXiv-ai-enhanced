We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on\npost-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.\nWe present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the\nsystem's core design through transparent belief representations and\nhierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a\nmedium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human\noversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture\nimplements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active\nInference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through\nhierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring\nsafety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in\nnatural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy\nminimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.\nThe paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our\nframework's safety properties.

Recent work by Kadekodi et al.\ndemonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can\nlead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such\nadaptations, known as \\emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of\n\\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes\nof different parameters.\n  In this work, we study the setting in which $\\lambda$ codewords of an initial\n$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a\nfinal $[n^F = \\lambda k^I + r^F,\\, k^F = \\lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by\npresenting three constructions that achieve optimal \\emph{access cost}, defined\nas the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first\ntwo constructions apply when $\\lambda \\leq r^I$ and impose specific\ndivisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize\nboth the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which\nbuilds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting\narbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that\nare linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction\nachieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS\nconjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that\noptimizes the \\emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols\ntransmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and\nRashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework,\nand achieves reduced sub-packetization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u7801\uff08convertible codes\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u78c1\u76d8\u6545\u969c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7801\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5373\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u7801\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06\u521d\u59cbMDS\u7801\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7801\u5b57\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8MDS\u7801\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u7801\u5b57\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u79cd\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u7b2c\u4e09\u79cd\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u4e86MDS\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u7801\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to\nsimple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a\nframework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a\nstructured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists\nconducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and\nparticipating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by\nfive scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on\ndata augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four\nbenchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully\nsupervised models, all while remaining independent of training data.

This presents a significant challenge for\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for\nevaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack\nfine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'\nlong-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux\nbenchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation\nand proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51\nreasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary\nline construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional\nevaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process\nquality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13\nleading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three\npivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in\nextended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).\nSecond, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when\nsolving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and\nenhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry\nreasoning improvement.
