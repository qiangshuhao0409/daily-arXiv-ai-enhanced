In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected\ninto the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a\nconversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a\nrecommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent\ncandidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task\nsemantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and\nrecommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream\nmethods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public\ndatasets."}

However, existing approaches typically\nrepresent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial\nexplosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,\nespecially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation\nresults in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory\nrequirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale\nproblems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN\nrepresentation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and\nexplicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our\napproach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid\nworld, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger\ngrid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and\nsubstantially improves policy generalization and success rates.

While prior research has primarily focused on identifying\nwhether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content\ninfluences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals\nthat people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text\nand visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We\npropose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify\nhow users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based\nagent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human\nresponses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response\nModel Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows\nT-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability\nand interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and\npractical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By\nhighlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information\nreception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks\nof AI-driven misinformation."}

We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both\ndirect and chain of thought prompting.\n  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform\npoorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,\noutput inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating\na systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.\n  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:\ncurrent LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the\nstructured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably\n(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating\ncounterfactuals).

However, despite growing interest in the usability of\neXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for\nusers with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates\naccessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature\nreview of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include\ndisabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.\nSecond, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that\noperationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)\npersona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and\nimplementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for\naccessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are\nmore comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that\nmultimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability."}
