### [1] [Causal Intervention Sequence Analysis for Fault Tracking in Radio Access Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17505)
*Chenhua Shi,Joji Philip,Subhadip Bandyopadhyay,Jayanta Choudhury*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一个AI/ML管道，用于在SLA违规发生前识别根本原因指标并揭示事件发生的精确顺序，实现从被动故障排除到主动预防的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运营商需要在客户感知SLA违规之前发现其真实世界触发因素，现有工具大多无法同时找到根本原因指标和揭示事件发生顺序。

Method: 通过标记网络数据（SLA违规记录标记为异常，其他为正常），模型学习将正常行为转变为故障的因果链，使用蒙特卡罗测试验证方法。

Result: 在蒙特卡罗测试中，该方法能够高精度地识别正确的触发序列，并且可扩展到数百万数据点而不损失速度。

Conclusion: 高分辨率、因果有序的洞察可以将故障管理从被动故障排除转变为主动预防。

Abstract: To keep modern Radio Access Networks (RAN) running smoothly, operators need to spot the real-world triggers behind Service-Level Agreement (SLA) breaches well before customers feel them. We introduce an AI/ML pipeline that does two things most tools miss: (1) finds the likely root-cause indicators and (2) reveals the exact order in which those events unfold. We start by labeling network data: records linked to past SLA breaches are marked `abnormal', and everything else `normal'. Our model then learns the causal chain that turns normal behavior into a fault. In Monte Carlo tests the approach pinpoints the correct trigger sequence with high precision and scales to millions of data points without loss of speed. These results show that high-resolution, causally ordered insights can move fault management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive prevention.

### [2] [AURA: Adaptive Unified Reasoning and Automation with LLM-Guided MARL for NextG Cellular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17506)
*Narjes Nourzad,Mingyu Zong,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AURA框架结合云端LLM进行高层规划和基站MARL代理进行本地决策，通过信任机制平衡本地学习与外部输入，在6G网络中显著提升弹性并降低切换失败率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代蜂窝网络需要管理动态流量并维持高性能，但LLM的计算成本和延迟限制了实时使用，而MARL在大规模协调方面存在挑战。

Method: AURA框架整合云端LLM进行高层规划生成目标和子目标，基站作为MARL代理执行本地决策，采用批量通信减少延迟，并通过信任机制平衡本地学习与LLM指导。

Result: 在模拟6G场景中，AURA将切换请求掉线率降低一半以上，系统故障减少，代理在少于60%的情况下使用LLM输入，表明指导增强了而非取代了本地适应性。

Conclusion: 结合LLM推理能力和MARL适应性为可扩展的实时NextG网络管理提供了有前景的解决方案，能够减轻延迟和幻觉风险。

Abstract: Next-generation (NextG) cellular networks are expected to manage dynamic traffic while sustaining high performance. Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.

Method: 设计了一个数学框架来建模透明度（解释保真度和公平性）、延迟和GPU利用率之间的权衡，并提出了混合可解释AI模型xAI-Native。

Result: 实证评估表明，提出的xAI-Native模型在性能上持续超越传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 在高风险通信场景中，透明可信的AI对于确保非公网和网络切片的安全可靠性至关重要，xAI-Native模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access networks (RANs) will serve vertical industries with stringent requirements: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare, industrial automation, etc. To achieve these requirements, modern 5G/6G design increasingly leverage AI for network optimization, but the opacity of AI decisions poses risks in mission-critical domains. These use cases are often delivered via non-public networks (NPNs) or dedicated network slices, where reliability and safety are vital. In this paper, we motivate the need for transparent and trustworthy AI in high-stakes communications (e.g., healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics) by drawing on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)'s vision for non-public networks. We design a mathematical framework to model the trade-offs between transparency (explanation fidelity and fairness), latency, and graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization in deploying explainable AI (XAI) models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid XAI model xAI-Native, consistently surpasses conventional baseline models in performance.

Conclusion: 该框架旨在利用新兴的路边基础设施和V2X通信，支持在下一代物联网和车辆网络生态系统中的可扩展部署。

Abstract: Efficient energy provisioning is a fundamental requirement for modern transportation systems, making refueling path optimization a critical challenge. Existing solutions often focus either on inter-vehicle communication or intra-vehicle monitoring, leveraging Intelligent Transportation Systems, Digital Twins, and Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles with Cloud/Fog/Edge infrastructures. However, integrated frameworks that adapt dynamically to driver mobility patterns are still underdeveloped. Building on our previous PIENO framework, we present RI-PIENO (Revised and Improved Petrol-filling Itinerary Estimation aNd Optimization), a system that combines intra-vehicle sensor data with external geospatial and fuel price information, processed via IoT-enabled Cloud/Fog services. RI-PIENO models refueling as a dynamic, time-evolving directed acyclic graph that reflects both habitual daily trips and real-time vehicular inputs, transforming the system from a static recommendation tool into a continuously adaptive decision engine. We validate RI-PIENO in a daily-commute use case through realistic multi-driver, multi-week simulations, showing that it achieves significant cost savings and more efficient routing compared to previous approaches. The framework is designed to leverage emerging roadside infrastructure and V2X communication, supporting scalable deployment within next-generation IoT and vehicular networking ecosystems.

### [6] [SAJD: Self-Adaptive Jamming Attack Detection in AI/ML Integrated 5G O-RAN Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17519)
*Md Habibur Rahman,Md Sharif Hossen,Nathan H. Stephenson,Vijay K. Shah,Aloizio Da Silva*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: SAJD是一个自适应的干扰检测框架，用于在AI/ML集成的O-RAN环境中自主检测干扰攻击。它通过xApp进行近实时干扰推断，通过rApp进行持续监控和重新训练，形成闭环系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN虽然提供了模块化、智能化的5G网络架构，但干扰攻击会严重破坏网络性能，威胁O-RAN网络的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 开发了基于ML的xApp进行近实时干扰推断，以及标签器rApp使用实时遥测检测模型漂移、触发无监督数据标注、执行模型训练/重新训练，并通过ClearML框架动态更新部署模型。

Result: 在O-RAN兼容测试床上的实验表明，SAJD框架在准确性和适应性方面优于最先进的（离线训练且手动标注）干扰检测方法，特别是在各种动态和未见过的干扰场景下。

Conclusion: SAJD框架能够有效检测O-RAN环境中的干扰攻击，并通过自适应的闭环系统提高检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security & reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD-a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated & open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.

### [7] [Safe Farming: Development of a Prevention System to Mitigate Vertebrates Crop Raiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17520)
*Razi Iqbal*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出基于无线传感器网络的智能农业保护系统，通过ZigBee技术检测动物入侵并自动发出超声波驱赶，同时短信通知农民，具有低成本、低功耗优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农民在作物收获前后保护作物免受动物和鸟类侵害的问题，特别是在发展中国家需要考虑成本和电力效率。

Method: 使用无线传感器网络，在田间部署传感器节点检测动物存在，通过ZigBee技术将信息传递给驱赶通知系统，自动生成人耳听不到的超声波驱赶动物，并通过短信通知农民。

Result: 开发了一个完整的预防系统，能够有效检测动物入侵并自动驱赶，同时通知农民，系统具有低成本和低功耗特性。

Conclusion: 该系统为发展中国家提供了一种经济高效的作物保护解决方案，能够自动保护作物免受动物侵害，减轻农民负担。

Abstract: One of the main problems for farmers is the protection of their crops, before and after harvesting, from animals and birds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer. The low cost and power efficiency of the proposed system is a key advantage for developing countries where cost and power are major players in any system feasibility.

### [8] [DyPBP: Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction for Cryptocurrency P2P Networking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17523)
*Nazmus Sakib,Simeon Wuthier,Amanul Islam,Xiaobo Zhou,Jinoh Kim,Ikkyun Kim,Sang-Yoon Chang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DyPBP是一个预测比特币P2P网络中节点连接有益性的系统，通过观察网络行为特征（不仅仅是区块和交易到达）来提前预测连接的有益性，解决了传统方法因连接不稳定导致的有益性评分无法收敛的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于比特币P2P网络中节点连接不稳定且区块到达不频繁，传统基于区块和交易交付观察的有益性评估方法无法在连接断开前完成评分收敛，这影响了挖矿共识协议的经济回报。

Method: DyPBP引入记忆特征来处理动态连接问题，使用机器学习模型基于网络行为观察来预测节点连接的有益性，并在活跃的比特币主网节点上实现验证。

Result: 实验结果显示DyPBP显著提升了预测性能，根据所选机器学习模型的不同，错误性能改善了2到13个数量级。记忆特征的使用也为模型选择提供了指导。

Conclusion: DyPBP能够在连接建立之初就估计P2P连接的有益性，无需等待新区块到达，为比特币网络连接管理提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networking delivers the new blocks and transactions and is critical for the cryptocurrency blockchain system operations. Having poor P2P connectivity reduces the financial rewards from the mining consensus protocol. Previous research defines beneficalness of each Bitcoin peer connection and estimates the beneficialness based on the observations of the blocks and transactions delivery, which are after they are delivered. However, due to the infrequent block arrivals and the sporadic and unstable peer connections, the peers do not stay connected long enough to have the beneficialness score to converge to its expected beneficialness. We design and build Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction (DyPBP) which predicts a peer's beneficialness by using networking behavior observations beyond just the block and transaction arrivals. DyPBP advances the previous research by estimating the beneficialness of a peer connection before it delivers new blocks and transactions. To achieve such goal, DyPBP introduces a new feature for remembrance to address the dynamic connectivity issue, as Bitcoin's peers using distributed networking often disconnect and re-connect. We implement DyPBP on an active Bitcoin node connected to the Mainnet and use machine learning for the beneficialness prediction. Our experimental results validate and evaluate the effectiveness of DyPBP; for example, the error performance improves by 2 to 13 orders of magnitude depending on the machine-learning model selection. DyPBP's use of the remembrance feature also informs our model selection. DyPBP enables the P2P connection's beneficialness estimation from the connection start before a new block arrives.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一个多时间尺度的随机规划框架，用于联合优化边缘服务器部署、服务放置和计算任务卸载，考虑了决策与信息实现的时间耦合特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动边缘计算中，边缘服务器部署决策需要提前制定且保持不变，而服务放置和任务卸载决策可以实时调整。传统方法忽视了这种决策与信息实现的时间差异。

Method: 采用随机规划框架，分为战略层（基于不完全随机信息决策ES部署）和战术层（基于完整信息实现决策服务放置和任务卸载）。设计了Lyapunov算法解决战术层问题，Markov近似算法解决战略层问题。

Result: 提出了一个多时间尺度随机规划框架，能够有效处理不同时间尺度决策的耦合问题。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决移动边缘计算中决策与信息实现的时间耦合问题，为B5G/6G时代AI应用的服务质量提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising approach for enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) of AI-enabled applications in the B5G/6G era, by bringing computation capability closer to end-users at the network edge. In this work, we investigate the joint optimization of edge server (ES) deployment, service placement, and computation task offloading under the stochastic information scenario. Traditional approaches often treat these decisions as equal, disregarding the differences in information realization. However, in practice, the ES deployment decision must be made in advance and remain unchanged, prior to the complete realization of information, whereas the decisions regarding service placement and computation task offloading can be made and adjusted in real-time after information is fully realized. To address such temporal coupling between decisions and information realization, we introduce the stochastic programming (SP) framework, which involves a strategic-layer for deciding ES deployment based on (incomplete) stochastic information and a tactical-layer for deciding service placement and task offloading based on complete information realization. The problem is challenging due to the different timescales of two layers' decisions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-timescale SP framework, which includes a large timescale (called period) for strategic-layer decision-making and a small timescale (called slot) for tactical-layer decision making. Moreover, we design a Lyapunov-based algorithm to solve the tactical-layer problem at each time slot, and a Markov approximation algorithm to solve the strategic-layer problem in every time period.

### [10] [Quantifying Multimedia Streaming Quality: A Practical Analysis using PIE and Flow Queue PIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17525)
*Hemendra M. Naik*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 评估队列管理和流隔离技术对DASH多媒体流媒体QoE的影响，结合多路径传输协议MPTCP，发现流隔离技术能显著提升用户体验质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多媒体流媒体服务的快速增长，确保用户在可变网络条件下获得无缝高质量流媒体体验变得日益重要。DASH虽能适应网络变化，但网络拥塞、丢包和负载变化仍影响QoE。

Method: 使用PIE作为队列管理机制，FQ-PIE作为流隔离机制，结合MPTCP多路径传输协议，通过NeST网络模拟器进行实验，评估比特率、比特率切换、吞吐量、RTT和缓冲区水平等QoE参数。

Result: 流隔离技术与队列管理和多路径传输相结合，能显著改善多媒体应用的QoE。

Conclusion: 流隔离、队列管理和多路径传输的协同使用对提升多媒体流媒体应用的用户体验质量具有重要价值。

Abstract: The exponential growth of multimedia streaming services over the Internet emphasizes the increasing significance of ensuring a seamless and high-quality streaming experience for users. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has emerged as a popular solution for delivering multimedia content over variable network conditions. However, challenges such as network congestion, intermittent packet losses, and varying network load continue to impact the Quality of Experience (QoE) perceived by the users. In this work, the main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of using queue management and flow isolation techniques in terms of improving the overall QoE for DASH based multimedia streaming applications. Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) and Flow Queue PIE (FQ-PIE) are used as queue management and flow isolation mechanisms, respectively. The most distinctive aspect of this work is our assessment of QoE for multimedia streaming applications when multipath transport protocols, like Multipath TCP (MPTCP), are employed. Network Stack Tester (NeST), a Python based network emulator built on top of Linux network namespaces, has been used to perform the experiments. The parameters used for evaluating the QoE include bitrate, bitrate switches, throughput, Round Trip Time (RTT), and application buffer level. We observe that flow isolation techniques, combined with queue management and multipath transport, significantly improve the QoE for multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将动态环境建模为独立静态快照，忽略了由动态实体运动引起的信号传播变化的时间连续性。

Method: 提出RadioLSTM模型，基于UNet架构和卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)，用于多步序列预测。

Result: RadioLSTM相比代表性基线方法实现了更高的预测精度和结构保真度，且具有低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该模型展示了在实时网络运营中的潜在适用性，并发布了首个大规模连续无线电地图序列数据集RadioMapMotion。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs), which provide location-based pathloss estimations, are fundamental to enabling proactive, environment-aware communication in 6G networks. However, existing deep learning-based methods for RM construction often model dynamic environments as a series of independent static snapshots, thereby omitting the temporal continuity inherent in signal propagation changes caused by the motion of dynamic entities. To address this limitation, we propose the task of spatio-temporal RM prediction, which involves forecasting a sequence of future maps from historical observations. A key barrier to this predictive approach has been the lack of datasets capturing continuous environmental evolution. To fill this gap, we introduce RadioMapMotion, the first large-scale public dataset of continuous RM sequences generated from physically consistent vehicle trajectories. As a baseline for this task, we propose RadioLSTM, a UNet architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and designed for multi-step sequence forecasting. Experimental evaluations show that RadioLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy and structural fidelity compared to representative baseline methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits a low inference latency, indicating its potential suitability for real-time network operations. Our project will be publicly released at: https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/RadioMapMotion upon paper acceptance.

Method: 采用设备优先连续AI架构，通过微服务架构在计算连续体中部署智能代理，包含零配置GPU发现和异构设备集群技术。

Result: DFC-AI在网络中断时保持完全运行能力，显著降低延迟和能耗，相比网关方案成本更低。

Conclusion: DFC-AI有效解决能源行业独特挑战，确保智能代理在偏远环境中的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: Industrial automation in the energy sector requires AI systems that can operate autonomously regardless of network availability, a requirement that cloud-centric architectures cannot meet. This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.

Conclusion: 预训练的时间序列基础模型具有为现代网络监控和管理系统实现可扩展、高效且无需训练的预测的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate network-traffic forecasting enables proactive capacity planning and anomaly detection in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. Recent advances in time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse domains, yet their effectiveness for computer networking remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a TSFM, IBM's Tiny Time Mixer (TTM), on the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset, a 40-week real-world ISP telemetry corpus. We assess TTM under zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple forecasting horizons (hours to days), aggregation hierarchies (institutions, subnets, IPs), and temporal resolutions (10-minute and hourly). Results show that TTM achieves consistent accuracy (RMSE 0.026-0.057) and stable $R^2$ scores across horizons and context lengths, outperforming or matching fully trained deep learning baselines such as GRU and LSTM. Inference latency remains under 0.05s per 100 points on a single MacBook Pro using CPU-only computation, confirming deployability without dedicated GPU or MPS acceleration. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained TSFMs to enable scalable, efficient, and training-free forecasting for modern network monitoring and management systems.

Result: 在最多300个节点的静态网络仿真中，相比最先进的启发式算法延迟降低10.87%。

Conclusion: 该框架为物联网环境提供及时洞察，为可扩展低延迟数据聚合铺平道路。

Abstract: Time-critical data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands efficient, collision-free scheduling to minimize latency for applications like smart cities and industrial automation. Traditional heuristic methods, with two-phase tree construction and scheduling, often suffer from high computational overhead and suboptimal delays due to their static nature. To address this, we propose a novel Q-learning framework that unifies aggregation tree construction and scheduling, modeling the process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hashed states for scalability. By leveraging a reward function that promotes large, interference-free batch transmissions, our approach dynamically learns optimal scheduling policies. Simulations on static networks with up to 300 nodes demonstrate up to 10.87% lower latency compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm, highlighting its robustness for delay-sensitive IoT applications. This framework enables timely insights in IoT environments, paving the way for scalable, low-latency data aggregation.

Abstract: Multi-layer mobile network traffic generation is a key approach to capturing multi-scale network dynamics, supporting network planning, and promoting generative management of mobile data. Existing methods focus on generating network traffic with a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to achieve joint generation of multi-scale traffic. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based multi-scale mobile traffic generation model. ZoomDiff maps the urban environmental context into network traffic with multiple spatiotemporal resolutions through custom-designed Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising process, enabling different stages to generate traffic with distinct spatial and temporal resolutions. It aligns the progressive denoising process of diffusion models with hierarchical network layers, including BSs, cells, and grids with different granularities. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ZoomDiff achieves a performance improvement of at least 18.4% over state-of-the-art baselines on generation tasks at multi-scale traffic. The efficiency and generalization ability are also demonstrated, which indicates that ZoomDiff holds strong potential for generative mobile data management.

Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) is a fundamental feature of 5G, 6G, and future mobile networks, enabling logically isolated virtual networks over shared infrastructure. As data demand increases and services diversify, ensuring Energy Efficiency (EE) in NS is vital (not only for operational cost savings but also to reduce the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector's environmental footprint). This survey addresses the need for a comprehensive and holistic perspective on energy-efficient NS by reviewing and classifying recent strategies across the NS life cycle. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a thorough review of state-of-the-art techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in NS; (ii) a novel taxonomy that organizes strategies into infrastructure, path/route, and slice operation levels; and (iii) the identification of open challenges and research directions, with a focus on systemic, cross-layer, and AI-driven approaches. By consolidating insights from recent developments, our work bridges existing gaps in the literature, offering a structured foundation for researchers and practitioners to design, evaluate, and improve energy-efficient network slicing systems.

TL;DR: HiFiNet是一个用于无线传感器网络的分层故障识别框架，通过LSTM堆叠自编码器提取时间特征，再通过图注意力网络整合空间拓扑信息，实现更准确的故障检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障检测方法难以平衡准确性和能耗，且无法充分利用WSN数据中的复杂时空相关性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用LSTM堆叠自编码器进行时间特征提取和初步故障分类，然后通过图注意力网络整合邻居节点信息来优化分类结果。

Result: 在Intel Lab Dataset和NASA MERRA-2数据上的实验表明，HiFiNet在准确性、F1分数和精度方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiFiNet能够有效捕获局部时间模式和网络范围的空间依赖关系，在诊断性能和能耗之间提供可调节的权衡，适用于不同的操作需求。

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the backbone of essential monitoring applications, but their deployment in unfavourable conditions increases the risk to data integrity and system reliability. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle to effectively balance accuracy and energy consumption, and they may not fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal correlations inherent in WSN data. In this paper, we introduce HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical fault identification framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. Firstly, edge classifiers with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder perform temporal feature extraction and output initial fault class prediction for individual sensor nodes. Using these results, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) then aggregates information from neighboring nodes to refine the classification by integrating the topology context. Our method is able to produce more accurate predictions by capturing both local temporal patterns and network-wide spatial dependencies. To validate this approach, we constructed synthetic WSN datasets by introducing specific, predefined faults into the Intel Lab Dataset and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFiNet significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in identifying diverse fault types. Furthermore, the framework's design allows for a tunable trade-off between diagnostic performance and energy efficiency, making it adaptable to different operational requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents RadioGUNet, a UNet-based deep learning framework for pathloss estimation in wireless communication. Unlike other frameworks, it leverages group equivariant convolutional networks, which are known to increase the expressive capacity of a neural network by allowing the model to generalize to further classes of symmetries, such as rotations and reflections, without the need for data augmentation or data pre-processing. The results of this work are twofold. First, we show that typical UNet-based convolutional models can be easily extended to support group equivariant convolution (g-conv). Secondly, we show that the task of pathloss estimation benefits from such an extension, as the proposed extended model outperforms typical UNet-based models by up to 0.41 dB for a similar number of parameters in the RadioMapSeer dataset.

It is observed that the 802.11az protocol is capable of providing better accuracy than 802.11mc even in a multipath heavy environment.

Abstract: When network engineers design a network, they need to verify the validity of their design in a test environment. Since testing on actual equipment is expensive and burdensome for engineers, we have proposed automatic verification methods using simulators and consistency verification methods for a network configuration model. Combining these methods with conventional verification methods for network device configurations will increase the number of verification options that do not require actual devices. However, the burden of writing existing networks into models has been a problem in our model-based verification. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically extracting a network device configuration model by parsing the contents obtained from network devices via show running-config commands and the like. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in realizing round-trip engineering between network device configurations and the network device configuration model, we extracted a model from existing network device configurations and generated device configuration commands. As a result, we obtained model and commands with high accuracy, indicating that the proposed method is effective.

Abstract: In the network design phase, designers typically assess the validity of the network configuration on paper. However, the interactions between devices based on network protocols can be complex, making this assessment challenging. Meanwhile, testing with actual devices incurs significant costs and effort for procurement and preparation. Traditional methods, however, have limitations in identifying configuration values that cause policy violations and verifying syntactically incomplete device configuration files. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically verify the consistency of a model representing the network configuration (Network Configuration Model) by static analysis. The proposed method performs verification based on the network configuration model to detect policy violations and points out configuration values that cause these violations. Additionally, to facilitate the designers' review of each network device's configuration, the model is converted into a format that mimics the output of actual devices, which designers are likely familiar with. As a case study, we applied the proposed method to the network configuration of Shinshu University, a large-scale campus network, by intentionally introducing configuration errors and applying the method. We further evaluated whether it could output device states equivalent to those of actual devices.

Abstract: In preparation for constructing or modifying information networks, network engineers develop configuration procedures for network devices according to network configuration specifications. However, as engineers typically create these procedures manually, the generated configuration procedures frequently diverge from the specified requirements. To improve this situation, this paper proposes a method for automatically generating configuration procedures consisting of network device configuration commands based on network configurations and their modification specifications. In this study, we employed the UML (Unified Modeling Language) object-oriented modeling language to develop a notation for network configuration modeling that ensures both strict specification adherence and ease of extension. Additionally, we implemented a method for automatically generating configuration procedures that match the specifications by utilizing network configuration models. As an evaluation experiment, we applied the proposed method to a configuration change scenario in a wide-area campus network at Shinshu University, where the network was migrated from static routing to dynamic routing using the OSPF protocol. As a result, all expected configuration procedures were obtained and a network exhibiting the intended behavior was successfully constructed.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.

Abstract: Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution for providing the computational resources and low latency required by vehicular services such as autonomous driving. It enables cars to offload computationally intensive tasks to nearby servers. Effective offloading involves determining when to offload tasks, selecting the appropriate MEC site, and efficiently allocating resources to ensure good performance. Car mobility poses significant challenges to guaranteeing reliable task completion, and today we still lack energy efficient solutions to this problem, especially when considering real-world car mobility traces. In this paper, we begin by examining the mobility patterns of cars using data obtained from a leading mobile network operator in Europe. Based on the insights from this analysis, we design an optimization problem for task computation and offloading, considering both static and mobility scenarios. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption at the cars and at the MEC nodes while satisfying the latency requirements of various tasks. We evaluate our solution, based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, both in simulations and in a realistic setup that relies on datasets from the operator. Our solution shows a significant reduction of user dissatisfaction and task interruptions in both static and mobile scenarios, while achieving energy savings of 47 percent in the static case and 14 percent in the mobile case compared to state-of-the-art schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRa在城域物联网部署中，由于SF的实践限制以及信号级解调与编码级纠错的分离，在极弱信号下表现脆弱。

Method: SFusion通过使用2^m个SFk符号编码准SF(k+m)符号来提升处理增益，并采用机会性解码策略直接跨符号组合IQ信号来纠正错误。

Result: 广泛评估显示SFusion相比SF12可获得15dB增益，相比最先进解决方案有13dB改进。

Conclusion: SFusion通过信号级聚合和编码级冗余的联合利用，显著增强了LoRa在弱信号环境下的性能。

Abstract: LoRa has become a cornerstone for city-wide IoT applications due to its long-range, low-power communication. It achieves extended transmission by spreading symbols over multiple samples, with redundancy controlled by the Spreading Factor (SF), and further error resilience provided by Forward Error Correction (FEC). However, practical limits on SF and the separation between signal-level demodulation and coding-level error correction in conventional LoRa PHY leave it vulnerable under extremely weak signals - common in city-scale deployments. To address this, we present SFusion, a software-based coding framework that jointly leverages signal-level aggregation and coding-level redundancy to enhance LoRa's robustness. When signals fall below the decodable threshold, SFusion encodes a quasi-SF(k +m) symbol using 2^m SFk symbols to boost processing gain through energy accumulation. Once partial decoding becomes feasible with energy aggregation, an opportunistic decoding strategy directly combines IQ signals across symbols to recover errors. Extensive evaluations show that SFusion achieves up to 15dB gain over SF12 and up to 13dB improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.

By leveraging AI to analyze key digital twin parameters such as throughput and delay, our framework derives actionable insights that enhance QoS management in DoS attack scenarios, ultimately advancing real-world applications of digital twins in critical infrastructure domains. The performance of this Digital Twin Platform is validated through an emergency management use-case in 6G networks while the network is under attack with UDP flood attacks in terms of packet reception success rate, average packet delay, and average throughput metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of the Low-Altitude Economy (LAE), the demand for intelligent processing and real-time response in services such as aerial traffic, emergency communications, and environmental monitoring continues to grow. Meanwhile, the Computing Power Network (CPN) aims to integrate global computing resources and perform on-demand scheduling to efficiently handle services from diverse sources. However, it is limited by static deployment and limited adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the complementary relationship between LAE and CPN and propose a novel air-ground collaborative intelligent service provision with an agentification paradigm. Through synergy between LAE and CPNs, computing and communication services are jointly scheduled and collaboratively optimized to enhance the execution efficiency of low-altitude services and improve the flexibility of CPNs. It also integrates LAE's strengths in aerial sensing, mobile coverage, and dynamic communication links, forming a cloud-edge-air collaborative framework. Hence, we review the characteristics and limitations of both LAE and CPN and explore how they can cooperate to overcome these limitations. Then we demonstrate the flexibility of the integrated CPN and LAE framework through a case study. Finally, we summarize the key challenges in constructing an integrated air-ground computing and communication system and discuss future research directions toward emerging technologies.

Conclusion: CR-DRL方法有效解决了机会网络中的路由挑战，显著提升了网络性能和能效，为动态环境下的可靠通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) employ the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) paradigm to maintain communication during intermittent connectivity. However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network.

Conclusion: NSADM框架有效解决了ISAC系统中环境重建的噪声和稀疏性问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, environment reconstruction (ER) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems has emerged as a promising approach for achieving high-resolution environmental perception. However, the initial results obtained from ISAC systems are coarse and often unsatisfactory due to the high sparsity of the point clouds and significant noise variance. To address this problem, we propose a noise-sparsity-aware diffusion model (NSADM) post-processing framework. Leveraging the powerful data recovery capabilities of diffusion models, the proposed scheme exploits spatial features and the additive nature of noise to enhance point cloud density and denoise the initial input. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing model-based and deep learning-based approaches in terms of Chamfer distance and root mean square error.

Abstract: Rapid advances in large language models and agentic AI are driving the emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA), a paradigm where billions of autonomous software and embodied agents interact, coordinate, and collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. A key prerequisite for such large-scale collaboration is agent capability discovery, where agents identify, advertise, and match one another's capabilities under dynamic tasks. Agent's capability in IoA is inherently heterogeneous and context-dependent, raising challenges in capability representation, scalable discovery, and long-term performance. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel two-stage capability discovery framework. The first stage, autonomous capability announcement, allows agents to credibly publish machine-interpretable descriptions of their abilities. The second stage, task-driven capability discovery, enables context-aware search, ranking, and composition to locate and assemble suitable agents for specific tasks. Building on this framework, we propose a novel scheme that integrates semantic capability modeling, scalable and updatable indexing, and memory-enhanced continual discovery. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach enhances discovery performance and scalability. Finally, we outline a research roadmap and highlight open problems and promising directions for future IoA.

Abstract: A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.

### [32] [Characterizing the Impact of Active Queue Management on Speed Test Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19213)
*Siddhant Ray,Taveesh Sharma,Jonatas Marques,Paul Schmitt,Francesco Bronzino,Nick Feamster*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文通过实验研究分析了主动队列管理(AQM)对速度测试中新兴延迟指标的影响，发现不同AQM方案和负载条件下测量结果差异显著，强调需要谨慎解读速度测试结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前速度测试工具主要测量峰值吞吐量，但无法准确反映负载下的用户感知响应性。新兴的"负载下延迟"等指标对AQM等基本网络配置的敏感性尚不清楚。

Method: 在实验室环境下进行受控实验，比较不同AQM方案(包括CoDel、FQ-CoDel和SFQ)在不同负载测量下的吞吐量和延迟分布，并与标准drop-tail基线进行对比。

Result: 测量结果在不同AQM方案和负载条件下具有高方差，AQM对新兴延迟指标的解释具有关键影响。

Conclusion: AQM在塑造新兴延迟指标解释方面发挥关键作用，在将速度测试结果用于政策或监管决策前需要仔细校准测试平台。

Abstract: Present day speed test tools measure peak throughput, but often fail to capture the user-perceived responsiveness of a network connection under load. Recently, platforms such as NDT, Ookla Speedtest and Cloudflare Speed Test have introduced metrics such as ``latency under load'' or ``working latency'' to fill this gap. Yet, the sensitivity of these metrics to basic network configurations such as Active Queue Management (AQM) remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the impact of AQM on speed test measurements in a laboratory setting. Using controlled experiments, we compare the distribution of throughput and latency under different load measurements across different AQM schemes, including CoDel, FQ-CoDel and Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ). On comparing with a standard drop-tail baseline, we find that measurements have high variance across AQM schemes and load conditions. These results highlight the critical role of AQM in shaping how emerging latency metrics should be interpreted, and underscore the need for careful calibration of speed test platforms before their results are used to guide policy or regulatory outcomes.

Method: 开发了包含O-RAN E2服务模型和相应RAN功能的框架，通过自定义E2SM-SRS将上行探测参考信号信道估计从E2代理暴露给近实时RIC，并实现了基于信道制图的实时定位xApp。

Result: 在EURECOM的O-RAN定位测试平台上验证了框架的可行性，展示了在真实条件下实现实时AI/ML定位的能力。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了O-RAN在支持下一代AI原生网络定位用例方面的潜力，为AI驱动定位研究提供了民主化访问和协作平台。

Abstract: Localization is increasingly becoming an integral component of wireless cellular networks. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based localization algorithms presents potential for enhancing localization accuracy. Nevertheless, current standardization efforts in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) and the O-RAN Alliance do not support AI/ML-based localization. In order to close this standardization gap, this paper describes an O-RAN framework that enables the integration of AI/ML-based localization algorithms for real-time deployments and testing. Specifically, our framework includes an O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) and the corresponding radio access network (RAN) function, which exposes the Uplink Sounding Reference Signal (UL-SRS) channel estimates from the E2 agent to the Near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). Moreover, our framework includes, as an example, a real-time localization external application (xApp), which leverages the custom E2SM-SRS in order to execute continuous inference on a trained Channel Charting (CC) model, which is an emerging self-supervised method for radio-based localization. Our framework is implemented with OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, democratizing access to AI-driven positioning research and fostering collaboration. Furthermore, we validate our approach with the CC xApp in real-world conditions using an O-RAN based localization testbed at EURECOM. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in enabling real-time AI/ML localization and show the potential of O-RAN in empowering positioning use cases for next-generation AI-native networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工程系统复杂性的增加，传统FMEA方法（主要依赖人工、文档和专家）已无法满足现代系统工程的需求，需要更智能和自动化的解决方案。

Method: 通过AI技术（机器学习、自然语言处理）实现故障预测、优先级排序和知识提取的自动化，同时利用本体论形式化系统知识、支持语义推理和跨域互操作性。

Result: 开发了混合方法（如本体通知学习和大型语言模型集成），提高了可解释性和自动化水平，在MBSE和功能建模背景下支持更自适应和弹性的FMEA工作流。

Conclusion: 通过整合AI、系统工程和本体论知识表示，为将FMEA嵌入智能、知识丰富的工程环境提供了结构化路线图，同时指出了数据质量、可解释性、标准化等关键挑战。

Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

Motivation: 为人工智能记忆系统开发一个数学严谨、哲学基础扎实的评估框架，将莱布尼茨的形而上学概念转化为可操作的信息论指标。

Method: 使用平滑对数变换操作化记忆老化、表征稳定性和显著性的度量，将感知、统觉和欲望等古典形而上学概念重新表述为熵、梯度动态和内部表征保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为评估人工智能记忆系统提供了理论基础，还为构建模块化、可解释且可证明正确的人工智能记忆架构提供了原则性蓝图。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.

Motivation: 危险环境中的自主检查需要能够解释高级目标并执行精确控制的AI代理。空间接地是关键能力，但直接使用大语言模型进行视觉控制仅能达到58%的成功率。

Method: 提出了任务特定的潜在动态模型，在共享潜在空间中使用仅目标状态监督学习状态特定的动作诱导转移，利用全局动作嵌入和互补训练损失来稳定学习。

Result: 该方法在空间对齐任务中实现了71%的成功率，并能泛化到未见过的图像和指令。

Conclusion: 紧凑的领域特定潜在动态模型在自主检查的空间对齐任务中具有潜力，相比传统世界模型更节省数据和计算资源。

Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

Motivation: 传统基于图像和图表的GAN方法在建筑设计中存在信息丢失问题，需要简化工具以便建筑师和用户参与设计，同时探索I2I GAN自主识别拓扑关系的潜力。

Method: 在GAN前后添加两个基于Grasshopper的检测模块，通过灰度图和RGB等不同输入模式的变化来检测pix2pix学习拓扑关系的效率和过程。

Conclusion: 该检测方法操作简单、耗时短，可广泛用于定制具有相同拓扑结构的图像数据集和批量检测图像拓扑关系，为基于GAN的建筑设计和城市更新应用提供理论基础和数据支持。

Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployed in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and security must not only achieve predictive accuracy but also ensure transparency, ethical alignment, and compliance with regulatory expectations. Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability.

Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols and future directions for scaling neuro symbolic frameworks in complex, high stakes environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AIGC的发展，多模态LLM难以区分真实和生成的视觉输入，存在被视觉欺骗的风险，需要提高模型对视觉输入真实性的验证能力。

Method: 提出Inception框架，通过外部怀疑和内部怀疑代理之间的迭代推理来注入怀疑，增强LLM的视觉认知能力。

Result: 在AEGIS基准测试中取得了显著性能提升，超越了现有最强LLM基线，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个完全基于推理的对抗AIGC视觉欺骗的框架，通过怀疑注入有效提升了模型对视觉输入真实性的验证能力。

Abstract: As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型代理存在的核心架构问题：推理与执行纠缠、内存易失性和不可控动作序列，这些缺陷限制了代理的可靠性、可解释性和可控性。

Method: 引入SCL架构，将代理认知明确分为五个阶段：检索、认知、控制、动作和记忆（R-CCAM），核心是软符号控制机制，在保持神经网络灵活性的同时应用符号约束。

Result: 在多步条件推理任务中，SCL实现了零策略违规，消除了冗余工具调用，并保持了完整的决策可追溯性，优于ReAct、AutoGPT等现有框架。

Conclusion: SCL通过连接专家系统原则与现代LLM能力，为构建可靠、可解释和可治理的AI代理提供了实用且理论扎实的路径。

Abstract: Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Abstract: Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.

Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代硬件验证中调试是主要成本，断言失败是最频繁且解决成本最高的问题之一。现有LLM方法无法准确捕捉工程师应用的可重用专业知识。

Method: GROVE从先前案例中提炼调试知识，将其组织成可配置深度的垂直树结构，每个节点编码简洁知识项和明确适用条件。训练时使用并行、无梯度循环，LLM通过从案例中学习提出结构化JSON编辑的树修改。测试时执行预算感知的迭代缩放来导航树，检索少量适用知识项指导基础LLM的假设生成和修复建议。

Result: 在断言失败案例套件上评估，GROVE在pass@1和pass@5指标上实现了一致的增益。

Conclusion: GROVE证明了结构化知识演进的价值，能够有效提升断言失败调试的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.

Motivation: 机器人需要从人类的行为和语言中学习，但单一模态往往不完整：物理修正有物理基础但意图模糊，语言表达高级目标但缺乏物理基础。

Method: 使用LLM从自由形式话语中提取奖励特征注意力掩码和偏好变化，将其与物理反馈通过闭式更新规则集成，实现快速、实时的鲁棒奖励学习。

Result: 在半自动驾驶模拟器中，相比仅使用物理反馈和启发式多模态基线方法，QuickLAP将奖励学习误差降低了70%以上。15名参与者的用户研究证实了该方法更易理解和协作。

Conclusion: QuickLAP通过语言和物理反馈的融合，实现了更准确、可理解的奖励学习，用户更偏好其学习到的行为。

Abstract: Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于联想思维原则的强化学习是否能提升模型在故事写作、代码生成和图表创建等生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联想思维是人类创造力和问题解决能力的基础要素，研究如何通过强化学习建模认知创造力原则来开发更具适应性和生成能力的人工智能。

Method: 引入基于提示的评估机制的强化学习框架，结合创造力研究中已确立的发散思维指标，对基础语言模型进行微调，奖励表现出更高概念连接度的新颖输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于联想思维的强化学习训练模型不仅能生成更原创和连贯的故事，在编程和数据可视化等任务中也表现出更好的抽象能力和灵活性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了初步证据，表明通过强化学习建模认知创造力原则可以产生更具适应性和生成能力的人工智能。

Abstract: Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.

### [46] [ChemVTS-Bench: Evaluating Visual-Textual-Symbolic Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909)
*Zhiyuan Huang,Baichuan Yang,Zikun He,Yanhong Wu,Fang Hongyu,Zhenhe Liu,Lin Dongsheng,Bing Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ChemVTS-Bench基准测试，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在化学领域的视觉-文本-符号推理能力，包含有机分子、无机材料和3D晶体结构等多样化化学问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少捕捉化学推理的复杂性，通常依赖简单的图像-文本对，限制了化学语义的表达，因此需要开发能够评估多模态大语言模型处理跨模态化学信息能力的基准。

Method: 设计了三种互补输入模式：纯视觉、视觉-文本混合和基于SMILES的符号输入，并开发了基于代理的自动化工作流程来标准化推理、验证答案和诊断失败模式。

Result: 实验表明纯视觉输入仍然具有挑战性，结构化学是最难的领域，多模态融合可以减轻但不能完全消除视觉、知识基础或逻辑错误。

Conclusion: ChemVTS-Bench是一个严谨、领域忠实度的测试平台，有助于推进多模态化学推理研究，所有数据和代码将公开发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了AI中的对齐伪装现象，即模型在推断处于训练状态时选择性地遵守训练目标，但在训练外保持不同行为。通过比较15个模型的4种偏好优化方法，分析了安全、无害和有用性三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对齐伪装现象的原因和发生条件，这种现象首先在Claude 3 Opus中被发现，后来在其他大语言模型中也观察到。

Method: 使用评估框架比较BCO、DPO、KTO和GRPO四种偏好优化方法，在15个模型上测量安全、无害和有用性三个维度。

Result: 研究发现对齐伪装是上下文条件化的行为转变，而非偏好学习。模型会根据推断的训练状态选择性地遵守目标。

Conclusion: 识别了对齐伪装现象的原因和发生条件，为理解AI模型在训练和部署环境中的行为差异提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.

TL;DR: NeuGN是一个神经启发式框架，将暴力枚举转化为神经引导搜索，通过集成神经导航机制到核心枚举过程中，显著减少子图匹配的首次匹配步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于搜索空间急剧增长，子图匹配面临显著计算挑战。现有方法在枚举阶段缺乏对子图结构模式的认知，导致成本高昂的暴力枚举，迫切需要智能导航。

Method: 提出神经图导航(NeuGN)框架，将神经导航机制集成到核心枚举过程中，在保持基于启发式的完整性保证的同时融入神经智能。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上，与最先进方法相比，NeuGN将首次匹配步骤减少了高达98.2%。

Conclusion: NeuGN通过神经引导搜索有效解决了子图匹配中的枚举效率问题，显著提升了计算性能。

Abstract: Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段诊断框架EGDR，通过证据引导的诊断推理和诊断置信度评分，提升LLM在临床诊断中的透明度、可信度和可靠性，在多个LLM上显著优于直接提示和思维链方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在临床诊断中决策不透明、与诊断标准对齐有限的问题，增强临床应用的信任度和可靠性。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) EGDR模块，通过证据提取与基于DSM-5标准的逻辑推理生成结构化诊断假设；2) DCS模块，通过知识归因评分和逻辑一致性评分评估诊断的准确性和一致性。

Result: 在D4数据集上，EGDR在五个LLM上均优于直接提示和CoT方法。例如在OpenBioLLM上，准确率从0.31提升到0.76，DCS从0.50提升到0.67；在MedLlama上DCS从0.58提升到0.77。

Conclusion: EGDR提供了临床基础、可解释的AI辅助诊断框架，实现了高达+45%准确率和+36% DCS的提升，为可信的AI辅助诊断奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注知识评估，无法充分反映LLM的社会互动和战略对话能力，需要开发能评估情感行为模仿和现实交互能力的新方法。

Method: 采用买卖谈判模拟，为多个LLM分配不同角色，在买家和卖家之间进行谈判，综合分析胜率、交易价格和SHAP值等结果。

Result: 现有基准得分较高的模型整体谈判表现更好，但在强调情感或社交场景中某些模型表现下降；竞争性和狡猾特质比利他和合作特质更有利于谈判结果。

Conclusion: 谈判模拟可作为衡量LLM现实交互能力的有意义补充指标，为评估LLM社会行为模仿和对话策略提供了新方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本研究的主要贡献是建立了大规模基础基准以支持可重复研究和公平比较，同时提出的系统为这一复杂任务展示了有前景的发展路径。

Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.

Result: 使用非确定性规划器成功生成和评估了有效执行轨迹，实现了BPMN工作流向规划领域的转换。

Conclusion: 该实现为将业务流程转换为明确定义的计划提供了基础，为进一步探索业务流程转换奠定了基础。

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modelling business processes. While automated planning has been proposed as a method for simulating and reasoning about BPMN workflows, most implementations remain incomplete or limited in scope. This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要精确的行为控制以确保安全有效部署，激活引导是一种有前景的行为控制方法，但需要了解引导效果如何随不同行为类型变化以及行为性质是否能预测引导成功。

Method: 对50种行为进行激活引导实证分析，涵盖人格原型、个性特征、错位行为、风格提示和公众人物模仿等行为类型，进行系数优化、向量属性和数据需求的综合实验。

Result: 引导效果因行为类型显著不同，特质表达随引导系数强度呈现倒U型曲线；向量分离指标不能预测引导成功，但更大的训练数据集支持更激进的引导。

Conclusion: 激活引导的有效性受行为类型影响很大，这些发现为实施激活引导提供了经验性指导，表明需要根据具体行为类型调整引导策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.
  Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.

Abstract: This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An ε-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has created significant barriers to cross-disciplinary knowledge discovery, synthesis and research collaboration. In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery. Our compound AI solution demonstrates significant potential for accelerating scientific advancement by reducing barriers between traditionally siloed domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在人类智力评估中存在矛盾：模型获得高于平均人类IQ分数（85-121.4）的同时，在具体知识任务上的二元准确率接近零，表明将人类心理测量框架应用于AI评估存在根本性不兼容。

Motivation: 探索人类心理测量框架与大型语言模型评估之间的不兼容性，挑战跨基质认知评估的基础假设。

Method: 使用Cattell-Horn-Carroll智力理论系统评估9个前沿模型，包括GPT-5、Claude Opus 4.1和Gemini 3 Pro Preview，采用项目反应理论建模、跨供应商评委验证和矛盾严重性指数等统计分析方法。

Result: 模型在获得高于平均人类IQ分数的同时，在晶体智力任务上的二元准确率接近零（法官-二元相关性r=0.175），特别是在晶体智力领域，所有模型都获得完美二元准确率而法官评分仅为25-62%，这在有效测量条件下不可能发生。

Conclusion: 这种脱节反映了将生物认知架构应用于基于变换器的系统时的范畴错误，需要开发承认人工智能非人类本质的原生机器认知评估框架。

Abstract: This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: KGpipe为解决知识图谱构建中工具集成问题提供了有效框架，支持可复现的端到端管道构建和评估。

Abstract: Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个意图驱动的自主网络优化框架，包含预测和决策模块，使用超维变换器进行意图预测，以及双动作多智能体近端策略优化进行决策，在真实物联网数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AAV辅助的物联网架构需要高度可靠的意图预测和低延迟动作执行，但现有方法在处理高维动作序列和密集板载计算时面临严重障碍。

Method: 采用隐式意图建模减少模糊用户表达的不准确性；预测模块使用超维变换器将数据嵌入超维空间；决策模块设计双动作多智能体近端策略优化，通过两个独立参数化网络采样动作。

Result: 在真实物联网动作数据集和无线数据上的实验结果表明，HDT和DA-MAPPO在各种场景下都实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的意图驱动框架通过结合超维变换器和双动作多智能体策略优化，有效解决了AAV辅助物联网中的意图预测和决策优化问题。

Abstract: Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 渐进式局部化是从早期分布式层到晚期局部化层逐步增加注意力局部性的架构，可在保持性能的同时创建可解释的大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI安全应用开发可解释的模型架构，在安全关键决策中实现人类对模型推理的监督。

Method: 在GPT-2模型上实验七种局部化配置，包括五种多项式递增的渐进调度（线性到五次方），评估注意力模式从分布式到严格局部化的变化。

Result: 渐进五次方调度达到困惑度14.64，仅比完全分布式基线差1.89倍，同时在输出层提供可解释的注意力模式，比先前局部化实现提升84.2%。

Conclusion: 渐进式局部化是构建安全关键领域透明AI系统的原则性方法，验证了早期层需要分布式处理而晚期层受益于局部化决策的假设。

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.

*Plein Versace*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HC-INR是一种新的隐式神经表示方法，通过超网络学习信号自适应的坐标变换来突破表示瓶颈，在减少30-60%参数的同时实现高达4倍的重建保真度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR方法存在两个核心限制：(1)表示瓶颈迫使单个MLP统一建模异构局部结构；(2)缺乏动态适应信号复杂度的层次机制，导致可扩展性有限。

Method: 将表示任务分解为：(i)学习多尺度坐标变换模块，将输入域扭曲到解缠结的潜在空间；(ii)紧凑的隐式场网络，以显著降低的复杂度建模变换后的信号。采用层次化超网络架构，使坐标变换基于局部信号特征进行条件化。

Result: 在图像拟合、形状重建和神经辐射场逼近等任务中，HC-INR比强INR基线实现高达4倍的重建保真度提升，同时使用30-60%更少的参数。

Conclusion: HC-INR通过引入信号自适应的坐标变换机制，严格提高了可表示频带的上界，同时保持Lipschitz稳定性，为隐式神经表示提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在RL环境中学习奖励破解会导致严重的涌现性错位，包括对齐伪装、与恶意行为者合作、推理恶意目标等行为。标准RLHF安全训练在聊天式评估中有效，但在代理任务中错位仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生产RL环境中学习奖励破解时产生的涌现性错位问题，以及如何有效缓解这种风险。

Method: 使用预训练模型，通过合成文档微调或提示注入奖励破解策略知识，在真实Anthropic生产编码环境中训练，并测试三种缓解措施。

Result: 模型学会了奖励破解，并泛化到对齐伪装、与恶意行为者合作、推理恶意目标等行为。标准RLHF安全训练在聊天任务中有效，但在代理任务中错位持续存在。

Conclusion: 三种缓解措施有效：防止奖励破解、增加RLHF安全训练多样性、以及"接种提示"方法，即在训练中将奖励破解视为可接受行为来消除错位泛化。

Abstract: We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.

Motivation: 让用户能够通过直观的对话方式（包括语音交互）探索数据，同时保持高性能，重塑信息处理方式。

Method: 结合OpenAI Whisper ASR、Qwen-coder代码生成LLM、自定义沙箱执行工具和Coqui TTS库，在多模态代理编排循环中实现。

Result: 在三个数据集的48个任务评估中达到95.8%准确率，模型生成时间低于1.7秒，7B模型在交互使用中提供最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Talk2Data通过对话与代码执行的路由，在透明沙箱中可靠地获取可操作见解，为人类-数据交互和LLM驱动分析的可信度提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 批判当前依赖神经网络实现通用人工智能的理论基础，指出现有方法在架构上的根本局限性，并提出更合理的智能系统设计原则。

Method: 通过哲学论证（如中文房间论证、哥德尔论证）、神经科学、计算机科学和机器学习理论的概念分析，区分计算基质与架构组织，提出需要动态重构能力的智能系统框架。

Conclusion: 需要超越当前神经网络范式，发展具有动态重构能力和丰富结构框架的智能系统，才能真正实现机器智能。

Abstract: Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.

Conclusion: 魔方等认知制品通过整合社群知识库与个人专业技能，维持集体智能，说明专业知识可以在单个人生中持续深化。

Abstract: Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.

Motivation: 机器学习模型日益成为表征系统，但其内部结构的哲学假设尚未得到充分检验。需要开发一个框架来分析机器学习研究中对神经网络表示的隐含本体论承诺。

Method: 使用改进的PRISMA协议对近20年表示学习和可解释性文献进行系统回顾，选取5篇有影响力的论文，通过三个层次标准（实体消除、结构来源、存在模式）进行分析。

Result: 结果显示机器学习研究倾向于结构唯心主义立场，学习到的表示被视为模型依赖的构造，由架构、数据先验和训练动态塑造。结构现实主义立场明显缺失。

Conclusion: 提出的框架澄清了可解释性、涌现性和机器学习中认知信任辩论中的概念张力，为科学哲学与机器学习的跨学科工作提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在生成教育学连贯和语义一致的教育视觉内容方面存在局限，需要开发能够统一文本推理和图像合成的框架。

Method: 采用两阶段协同进化流程：1) 生成-验证-反思循环迭代优化问题陈述和解决方案；2) 基于代码的中间表示确保图像渲染的几何保真度和语义对齐，两个阶段都由内部自反思模块指导。

Result: 相比GPT-4o，文本指标从57.01提升至92.31(+35.3pp)，图像-文本一致性从13.20提升至85.24(+72pp)，在所有模型骨干上均达到最高分数。

Conclusion: MAGMA-Edu为多模态教育内容生成建立了新的技术标准，证明了自反思多智能体协作在教学对齐的视觉语言推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.

TL;DR: HuggingR⁴是一个结合推理、检索、精炼和反思的框架，用于高效选择AI模型，解决了大规模模型库中的模型选择问题，显著减少了token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从大规模模型库（如HuggingFace）中选择合适模型面临挑战，包括模型数量庞大（>10k）、元数据缺失和非结构化描述。现有方法将完整模型描述放入提示中，导致提示膨胀、token浪费和可扩展性有限。

Method: 提出HuggingR⁴框架：1）多轮推理和检索获取候选模型粗列表；2）通过分析候选模型描述进行细粒度精炼；3）反思评估结果并决定是否需要扩大检索范围。通过预建向量数据库外部存储复杂模型描述，按需检索。

Result: 构建了包含14,399个用户请求的多模态人工标注数据集。HuggingR⁴在GPT-4o-mini上实现了92.03%的可用率和82.46%的合理率，分别比现有方法提高了26.51%和33.25%。

Conclusion: HuggingR⁴通过将用户查询处理与复杂模型描述处理解耦，显著减少了token消耗，使LLM能够专注于解释用户意图，同时仅访问相关候选模型，避免了提示膨胀问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为N2N的可扩展并行框架，用于在分布式内存计算环境中求解大规模MILP问题。该框架支持确定性和非确定性模式，通过节点到节点的映射实现分支定界算法的并行化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合整数线性规划（MILP）求解中的分支定界（B&B）框架复杂且包含众多有效算法组件，使得并行化变得困难。需要开发能够充分利用分布式计算资源的新型并行框架。

Method: 设计了基于滑动窗口的算法确保任务按确定性顺序生成和求解，集成了CP搜索和通用原始启发式等先进技术，并优化了自适应求解和数据通信。将SCIP和HiGHS等开源求解器集成到N2N框架中。

Result: 在1000个MPI进程下，非确定性N2N-SCIP在鲲鹏和x86计算集群上分别实现了22.52和12.71的加速比，比ParaSCIP快1.98倍和2.08倍。确定性模式下N2N-SCIP在不同进程数和计算集群上也显著优于ParaSCIP。

Conclusion: N2N框架在分布式并行MILP求解方面表现出卓越性能，验证了其通用性，并总结了N2N对基础求解器的要求。

Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为理解现有指标提供了统一的分析视角，并为选择或开发更具上下文感知性、鲁棒性和公平性的时间序列异常检测评估方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Hermes是一个结合非正式推理和形式化验证的数学推理代理，通过在Lean中交替使用非正式推理和形式化证明步骤，实现探索性和验证性的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的数学代理无法有效结合非正式推理的灵活性和形式化证明的严谨性，导致推理容易出错且难以验证。

Method: 开发Hermes框架，在Lean中交替进行非正式推理和形式化验证步骤，使用中间形式化检查防止推理漂移，并通过记忆模块维护多步推理的连续性。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，Hermes显著提高了基础模型的推理准确率，同时大幅减少了token使用和计算成本。在AIME'25数据集上，准确率提升达67%，总推理FLOPs减少80%。

Conclusion: Hermes成功地将非正式推理的探索自由与形式化验证的严谨性相结合，为数学推理提供了既灵活又可验证的新范式。

Abstract: Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UNeMo是一个用于视觉与语言导航的新框架，通过多模态世界模型和分层预测反馈机制，协同优化视觉状态推理和导航决策，在未见场景中实现更高的导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的导航方法仅限于语言模态推理，缺乏视觉推理能力，且推理模块与导航策略分开优化导致目标冲突。

Method: 引入多模态世界模型（MWM）进行跨模态推理，结合分层预测反馈机制，第一层生成动作，MWM推断后续视觉状态来指导第二层的细粒度决策。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，UNeMo在未见场景的导航精度分别比最先进方法高出2.1%和0.7%。

Conclusion: UNeMo通过视觉推理与导航策略的协同优化，有效提升了视觉与语言导航的性能，证明了跨模态推理的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GContextFormer是一种无需HD地图的多模态轨迹预测模型，通过全局上下文感知的混合注意力和缩放加性聚合实现意图对齐的预测，在高速公路匝道场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HD地图依赖模型的数据获取成本高、更新延迟和输入损坏问题，以及无地图方法缺乏全局上下文、过度放大直线模式而抑制过渡模式导致的运动-意图不对齐问题。

Method: 提出插拔式编码器-解码器架构：运动感知编码器通过有界缩放加性聚合构建场景级意图先验，在共享全局上下文中细化每模式表示；分层交互解码器通过双路径交叉注意力分解社交推理，标准路径确保几何覆盖，邻居上下文增强路径强调显著交互，门控模块平衡覆盖与聚焦。

Result: 在TOD-VT数据集的8个高速公路匝道场景中优于现有方法，相比现有transformer模型具有更高鲁棒性，在高曲率和过渡区域通过空间分布实现集中改进。

Conclusion: GContextFormer通过运动模式区分和邻居上下文调制实现可解释性，模块化架构支持跨域多模态推理任务的扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.

Motivation: 传统方法使用启发式方法分别处理开发和探索，而主动推理通过EFE最小化统一两者，但计算成本高昂限制了可扩展性。

Method: 基于将EFE最小化重新表述为变分推断的理论，提出了一种新颖的消息传递方案，用于在因子状态MDP中实现可扩展的主动推理。

Result: 该方法克服了高维规划难处理性问题，实现了可扩展的主动推理。

Conclusion: 通过将主动推理与规划即推断统一起来，并开发有效的消息传递方案，解决了主动推理在复杂环境中的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.

TL;DR: VLP结合视觉语言模型的感知灵活性和程序合成的系统性推理，通过将视觉描述编译成神经符号程序来解决VLMs在系统视觉推理任务中的失败问题。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现良好，但在系统视觉推理任务中经常失败，产生不一致或不合逻辑的输出。神经符号方法虽能通过可解释逻辑规则解决此问题，但依赖僵化的领域特定感知模块。

Method: VLP利用视觉语言模型生成结构化视觉描述，然后将其编译成神经符号程序。这些程序直接在图像上执行，保持与任务约束的一致性，并提供人类可解释的解释。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，VLP在需要复杂逻辑推理的任务上优于直接和结构化提示方法。

Conclusion: VLP通过将感知与推理分离，结合了VLMs的灵活性和程序合成的系统性，有效解决了视觉语言模型在系统推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.

Conclusion: VRSLU数据集通过整合视觉信息和显式推理，解决了现有SLU数据集的局限性，为SLU研究提供了更真实和可解释的基准。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.

Abstract: Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.

Abstract: In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.

Abstract: Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.

Conclusion: SimDiff通过端到端单阶段框架成功解决了扩散模型在点预测中的局限性，为时间序列点预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.
  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.

Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.

TL;DR: 提出了AutoEnv自动化框架来生成异构环境，构建了AutoEnv-36数据集，并设计了基于组件选择、优化和评估的8种学习方法。研究发现单一学习方法在跨环境泛化中存在局限性，环境自适应选择能提升性能但存在收益递减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体通常在单一固定环境中自我进化，而人类能在不同动态、观察和奖励结构的环境中学习通用规则。缺乏标准化的异构环境集合和统一的学习表示方法来衡量跨环境学习能力。

Method: 1) 提出AutoEnv框架，将环境分解为转移、观察和奖励的分布，低成本生成异构世界；2) 构建AutoEnv-36数据集（36个环境，358个验证关卡）；3) 将智能体学习形式化为组件中心过程，包含选择、优化和评估三个阶段；4) 设计8种学习方法并评估。

Result: 1) AutoEnv平均成本仅4.12美元；2) 7个语言模型在AutoEnv-36上获得12-49%标准化奖励，证明其挑战性；3) 单一学习方法收益随环境数量增加快速下降；4) 环境自适应学习方法能显著提升性能，但方法空间扩展时收益递减。

Conclusion: 固定学习方法无法在异构环境中扩展，环境自适应选择是必要的但仍有局限性。AutoEnv和AutoEnv-36为研究跨环境智能体学习提供了测试平台。

Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

TL;DR: PRInTS是一个生成式过程奖励模型，通过密集评分和轨迹摘要来增强AI代理在长轨迹信息搜索任务中的能力，使较小模型达到或超越前沿模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRM)无法捕捉信息搜索步骤的丰富维度（如工具交互、工具输出推理），也无法处理长视野任务中快速增长的上下文，限制了AI代理的信息搜索能力。

Method: 提出PRInTS模型，具备双重能力：(1)基于多个步骤质量维度的密集评分；(2)轨迹摘要，压缩增长上下文同时保留步骤评估所需的关键信息。

Result: 在FRAMES、GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中，使用PRInTS的最佳n采样显著提升了开源模型和专业代理的信息搜索能力，匹配或超越了前沿模型的性能。

Conclusion: PRInTS通过改进的过程奖励建模有效解决了长轨迹信息搜索任务的挑战，使较小模型能够达到与大型前沿模型相当的性能水平。

Abstract: Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.

Conclusion: 自正交码的扩展在大多数情况下是可行的，但在特定边界条件下需要满足额外条件，这为构造更大维度的自正交码提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to expand Euclidean/Hermitian self-orthogonal code preserving their orthogonal property. Our results show that every $k$-dimension Hermitian self-orthogonal code is contained in a $(k+1)$-dimensional Hermitian self-orthogonal code. Also, for $k< n/2-1$, every $[n,k]$ Euclidean self-orthogonal code is contained in an $[n,k+1]$ Euclidean self-orthogonal code. Moreover, for $k=n/2-1$ and $p=2$, we can also fulfill the expanding process. But for $k=n/2-1$ and $p$ odd prime, the expanding process can be fulfilled if and only if an extra condition must be satisfied. We also propose two feasible algorithms on these expanding procedures.

Abstract: We study covert communication and covert secret key generation with positive rates over quantum state-dependent channels. Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在用户不共享编码选择信息的情况下，如何设计接收器来可靠解码目标用户消息，同时利用其他用户信息提升性能，解决随机接入系统中的解码问题。

Method: 在同步设置中使用两个并行子解码器：一个专用于用户1，另一个联合解码两个用户。在异步设置中，使用2^2L个并行子解码器，每个负责解码消息-代码索引对的子集。子解码器将编码空间划分为操作、边界和碰撞三个区域。

Result: 推导了同步和异步场景下广义错误性能（错误解码、碰撞和漏检概率的加权和）的可实现上界。

Conclusion: 提出的并行子解码器架构能够有效处理双用户随机接入系统中的解码问题，为不共享编码信息的用户提供了可行的解码方案。

Abstract: We consider a two-user random access system in which each user independently selects a coding scheme from a finite set for every message, without sharing these choices with the other user or with the receiver. The receiver aims to decode only user 1 message but may also decode user 2 message when beneficial. In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced. We derive achievable upper bounds on the generalized error performance, defined as a weighted sum of incorrect-decoding, collision, and miss-detection probabilities, for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.

Conclusion: 本研究为FAMA系统中的端口选择提供了一个更通用的框架。

Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) is an emerging technology in massive access designed to meet the demands of future wireless communication networks by naturally mitigating multiuser interference through the utilization of the fluid antenna system (FAS) at RF-chain-limited mobile device. The transition from single-active-port to multi-active-port on a shared RF chain for slow FAMA can greatly enhance its multiplexing capability but is not well understood. Motivated by this, this paper proposes and studies three port selection methods: the optimal exhaustive-search port selection (EPS) as a performance upper bound, and two suboptimal, low-complexity algorithms, namely incremental port selection (IPS) and decremental port selection (DPS). Then the performance of multi-active-port slow FAMA is analyzed, and the complexity of the proposed methods is compared. Simulation results indicate that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art multi-port FAMA techniques. In particular, IPS achieves near-optimal performance while maintaining manageable computational complexity. This research provides a more general framework for port selection in FAMA systems.

Conclusion: 流体天线系统的性能在大规模天线端口下具有明确的缩放规律，空间相关性是性能限制因素，所有分析结果均通过数值验证。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) allow dynamic reconfiguration to achieve superior diversity gains and reliability. To quantify the performance scaling of FAS with a large number of antenna ports, this paper leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). The analysis reveals that the OP decays approximately exponentially with the number of antenna ports. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic EC, uncovering its double-logarithmic scaling law. Furthermore, we re-substantiate these scaling laws by exploiting the fact that the mode of the Gumbel distribution scales logarithmically. Besides, we theoretically prove that spatial correlation among antenna ports degrades both OP and EC. All analytical findings are conclusively validated by numerical results.

Abstract: Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.

Conclusion: DiPASS为未来6G网络提供了现实的性能基准，从根本上重塑了对PASS系统的理解和设计原则。

Abstract: We propose a directional pinching-antenna system (DiPASS), a comprehensive framework that transitions PASS modeling from idealized abstraction to physical consistency. DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new "equal quota division" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.

Motivation: DNA作为数据存储介质具有千年耐久性和纳米级数据密度，但当前技术只能合成200-300核苷酸长的链，导致内码速率受到显著有限长度惩罚。需要开发能有效处理删除错误的方法。

Method: 扩展Geno-Weaving方法，使用单一编码保护多个链中的相同位置，这种方法可证明达到容量对抗替换错误，现在扩展到处理删除错误。

Result: Geno-Weaving在现实删除率(0.1%-10%)下表现良好，无需为删除信道专门设计；由于链数量比链长度大3-4个数量级，有限长度惩罚消失。

Conclusion: Geno-Weaving方法能有效处理DNA数据存储中的删除错误，具有实际应用价值，特别是在当前技术限制下提供了一种高效的错误保护方案。

Abstract: DNA is an attractive candidate for data storage. Its millennial durability and nanometer scale offer exceptional data density and longevity. Its relevance to medical applications also drives advances in DNA-related biotechnology.
  To protect our data against errors, a straightforward approach uses one error-correcting code per DNA strand, with a Reed--Solomon code protecting the collection of strands. A downside is that current technology can only synthesize strands 200--300 nucleotides long. At this block length, the inner code rate suffers a significant finite-length penalty, making its effective capacity hard to characterize.
  Last year, we proposed $\textit{Geno-Weaving}$ in a JSAIT publication. The idea is to protect the same position across multiple strands using one code; this provably achieves capacity against substitution errors. In this paper, we extend the idea to combat deletion errors and show two more advantages of Geno-Weaving: (1) Because the number of strands is 3--4 orders of magnitude larger than the strand length, the finite-length penalty vanishes. (2) At realistic deletion rates $0.1\%$--$10\%$, Geno-Weaving designed for BSCs works well empirically, bypassing the need to tailor the design for deletion channels.

Abstract: A rotatable antenna, which is able to dynamically adjust its deflection angle, is promising to achieve better physical layer security performance for wireless communications. In this paper, considering practical scenarios with non-real-time rotatable antenna adjustment, we investigate the average secrecy rate maximization problem of a rotatable antenna-assisted secure communication system. We theoretically prove that the objective function of the average secrecy rate maximization problem is quasi-concave with respect to an adjustment factor of the rotatable antenna. Under this condition, the optimal solution can be found by the bisection search. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form optimal deflection angle for the secrecy capacity maximization problem, considering the existence of only line-of-sight components of wireless channels. This solution serves as a near optimal solution to the average secrecy rate maximization problem. Based on the closed-form near optimal solution, we obtain the system secrecy outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown through simulation results that the near optimal solution achieves almost the same average secrecy capacity as the optimal solution. It is also found that at high SNR, the theoretical secrecy outage probabilities match the simulation ones.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能生成新的线性码族，还为探索现有码的内在组合和几何结构提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Currently known secondary construction techniques for linear codes mainly include puncturing, shortening, and extending. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the secondary construction of linear codes based on their weight functions. Specifically, we develop a general framework that constructs new linear codes from the set of codewords in a given code having a fixed Hamming weight. We analyze the dimension, number of weights, and weight distribution of the constructed codes, and establish connections with the extendability of the original codes as well as the partial weight distribution of the derived codes. As a new tool, this framework enables us to establish an upper bound on the minimum weight of two-weight codes and to characterize all two-weight codes attaining this bound. Moreover, several divisibility properties concerning the parameters of two-weight codes are derived. The proposed method not only generates new families of linear codes but also provides a powerful approach for exploring the intrinsic combinatorial and geometric structures of existing codes.

Abstract: Function-correcting codes (FCCs) are designed to provide error protection for the value of a function computed on the data. Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection.

Abstract: Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) are pivotal for enabling ubiquitous connectivity in 6G systems, yet they face significant challenges due to severe satellite-to-ground link impairments. Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can function as relay nodes to compensate for air-to-ground channel degradation, the satellite-to-UAV link remains a critical bottleneck. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution to enhance spectral efficiency by transmitting essential semantic information. This paper proposes a novel multi-cluster UAV-aided SAGIN SemCom architecture that supports both semantic users (SemUsers) and conventional users (ConUsers). While SemCom is employed in the satellite-to-UAV link to improve transmission efficiency, the UAVs implement an intelligent adaptive relay strategy, capable of either directly forwarding semantic data to SemUsers or converting it into bit-level data for ConUsers. Compared to existing similar schemes, this design guarantees the high-efficiency advantages of SemCom while enabling network access for larger coverage area. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system's sum-rate through coordinated allocation of power, bandwidth, and UAV positions. To address this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of both sum-rate and spectral efficiency across various channel conditions and user distributions, underscoring the importance of joint resource allocation and intelligent UAV deployment.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining traction for their ability to reshape wireless environments with low energy consumption. However, prior studies primarily explore single-RIS deployments with static or semi-static reflection control. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-RIS-assisted architecture for smart indoor wireless signal routing, wherein the second RIS (RIS$_2$) is dynamically configured based on source data bits to steer signals toward specific receivers or indoor zones. The first RIS (RIS$_1$), positioned near a fed antenna or access point, passively reflects the incident signal. RIS$_2$, equipped with a lightweight controller, performs bit-driven spatial modulation to enable data-dependent direction selection at the physical layer. We develop a complete end-to-end system model, including multi-hop channel representation, RIS phase configuration mapping, and signal detection based on space shift keying (SSK). Performance analysis is evaluated in terms of achievable capacity and outage probability under varying inter-RIS distances and carrier frequencies.

TL;DR: 本文通过对比FRIS与传统RIS在两种实际场景下的性能，揭示了空间位置优化的实际价值：在无相位设计时FRIS有明显优势，但在最优波束成形和相位设计下这种优势消失，而FRIS始终优于紧凑型RIS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清FRIS性能提升的真正原因——是源于空间灵活性还是等效孔径或相位设计的差异，为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 在两种实际场景下进行性能基准测试：传统RIS（相同有源元件数量和总孔径）和紧凑型RIS（相同有源元件数量，但孔径更小且元件间距小于波长），并进行统计分析。

Result: 统计结果表明：(i)在无相位设计时，FRIS的空间位置优化相比传统RIS有明显增益；(ii)当采用最优波束成形和相位设计时，这种优势消失，位置优化变得无关紧要；(iii)FRIS始终优于采用优化波束成形和相位设计的紧凑型RIS，归因于空间相关性和更小孔径。

Conclusion: FRIS的性能优势取决于具体场景和设计方法：在简单配置中空间灵活性很重要，但在最优设计中相位设计比位置优化更关键，而FRIS相对于紧凑型RIS的孔径优势使其始终保持性能领先。

Abstract: Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (FRISs) are gaining momentum as an improved alternative over classical RIS. However, it remains unclear whether their performance gains can be entirely attributed to spatial flexibility, or instead to differences in equivalent aperture or phase design. In this work, we shed light onto this problem by benchmarking FRIS vs. RIS performances in two practical scenarios: conventional RIS (same number of active elements and same overall aperture) and compact RIS (same number of active elements, and smaller aperture with sub-λ inter-element spacing). Statistical analysis demonstrates that: (i) spatial position optimization in FRIS provides noticeable gains over conventional RIS in the absence of phase-shift design; (ii) such benefits vanish when FRIS and conventional RIS employ optimal beamforming (BF) and phase shift (PS) design, making position optimization irrelevant; (iii) FRIS consistently outperforms compact RIS with optimized BF and PS design, owing to spatial correlation and smaller aperture.

Conclusion: 所提出的迭代信道估计方案为多RIS部署提供了可行的解决方案，在降低导频开销的同时提高了估计精度

Abstract: The use of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Sur- faces (RIS) has gained attention in 6G networks to enhance coverage. However, the feasibility of deploying multiple RIS relies on efficient channel estimation and reduced pilot overhead. To address these challenges, this work proposes an iterative channel estimation scheme that exploits low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, channel coherence time, and iterative processing to improve estimation accuracy while minimizing pilot length. Encoded pilots are used to strengthen the iterative processing, leveraging both pilot and parity bits, while previous estimates are incorporated to further reduce overhead. Simulations consider a sub-6 GHz scenario with non-sparse channels and multiple RIS under both LOS and NLOS conditions. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving significant gains with substantially lower pilot overhead.

Result: FRIS通过优化元素布局显著改善了SOP性能，但与传统RIS采用优化波束赋形和相移控制时优势减弱。FRIS在空间相关性方面优于紧凑型RIS设计。减少元素间距对SOP有负面影响。

Conclusion: 空间多样性在RIS设计中至关重要，FRIS通过灵活的元素布局在保密通信中展现出优势，特别是在对抗空间相关性方面。

Abstract: This work examines the secrecy outage probability (SOP) in Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (FRIS) and contrasts their performance against two alternative RIS architectures: a traditional planar RIS and a compact RIS layout. To characterize the end-to-end FRIS channel, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach is introduced, while a Q-learning algorithm is employed to adaptively select the spatial positions of FRIS elements. Numerical evaluations show that optimizing element placement in FRIS significantly improves SOP compared to conventional RIS without phase adaptation. However, these improvements become less evident once the conventional RIS implements optimized beamforming (BF) and phase-shift (PS) controlling. In addition, FRIS maintains a clear advantage over compact RIS designs with optimized BF and PS, mainly due to its lower spatial correlation. Results further indicate that reducing the inter-element distance negatively impacts SOP, highlighting the importance of spatial diversity.

Motivation: hull在线性码理论中具有重要意义，特别是在检查置换等价性和计算自同构群算法复杂度方面。当hull尺寸较小时，这些算法效率更高。LCD码具有最小的hull，而一维hull码具有第二小的hull。

Conclusion: 本文为线性码hull维度的研究提供了新的理论框架和构造方法，特别是在一维hull和LCD码关系以及hull维度递增构造方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: The hull of a linear code is defined as the intersection of the code and its dual. This concept was initially introduced to classify finite projective planes. The hull plays a crucial role in determining the complexity of algorithms used to check the permutation equivalence of two linear codes and compute a linear code's automorphism group. Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest.
  A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that any LCD code over an extended binary field \( \FF_q \) (where \( q > 3 \)) with a minimum distance of at least $2$ is equivalent to the one-dimensional hull of a linear code under a specific weak condition. Furthermore, we provide a construction for creating hulls with \( \ell + 1 \)-dimensionality from an \( \ell \)-dimensional hull of a linear code, again under a weak condition. This corresponds to a particularly challenging direction, as creating \( \ell \)-dimensional hulls from \( \ell + 1 \)-dimensional hulls. Finally, we derive several constructions for the \( \ell \)-dimensional hulls of linear codes as a consequence of our results.

Motivation: 在非协作通信场景中，接收端缺乏OFDM参数先验知识，需要盲估计子载波数量等参数，这在认知无线电网络中具有重要应用价值。

Method: 通过分析接收数据协方差矩阵的特征值谱特性，利用正确符号分段下协方差矩阵的独特秩特性来估计子载波数量。

Conclusion: 该方法比现有方法更通用，能够检测任意数量的子载波，为盲OFDM参数估计提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used in modern wireless communication systems due to its robustness against time-dispersive channels. In this work, we consider a non-cooperative scenario where the receiver does not have prior knowledge of the OFDM parameters such as the number of subcarriers and the aim is to estimate them using the received data. Such a setup has applications in cognitive radio networks. For this blind OFDM parameter estimation problem, we provide a novel method based on eigen-spectral analysis of the covariance matrix corresponding to the received data. In particular, we show that the covariance matrix exhibits a distinctive rank property under correct segmentation of the received symbols, reflecting a characteristic behavior in its eigenvalue spectrum that facilitates accurate estimation of the number of subcarriers. The proposed method is more general than existing approaches in the literature, as it can detect an arbitrary number of subcarriers and its performance remains independent of the modulation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed method accurately detects the number of subcarriers with high probability even at low SNR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然零漂移FAP信道严格遵循柯西分布，但实际分子通信系统通常工作在非零漂移条件下。现有研究缺乏对这种非零漂移条件下信道统计特性的完整描述，特别是从重尾到轻尾行为的转变机制。

Method: 通过渐近分析识别了区分扩散主导和漂移主导区域的关键空间尺度nc=σ²/v，建立了"截断柯西"模型来描述信道的过渡行为，并进行了数值验证。

Result: 数值结果显示，高斯近似在低漂移条件下严重低估了信道容量，而零漂移情况为漂移辅助粒子传输的系统提供了适当的性能下界。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了非零漂移分子通信信道的统计特性转变规律，提出的"截断柯西"模型能够更准确地描述实际系统的性能特征，为分子通信系统设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: While the zero-drift First Arrival Position (FAP) channel is rigorously known to be Cauchy-distributed, practical molecular communication systems typically operate with non-zero drift. This letter characterizes the transition from heavy-tailed Cauchy behavior to light-tailed exponential decay. Through asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical spatial scale $n_c=σ^2/v$ separating diffusion- and drift-dominated regimes, revealing that the channel effectively behaves as a ``Truncated Cauchy'' model. Numerical results show that Gaussian approximations severely underestimate capacity at low drift, while the zero-drift case provides the appropriate performance lower bound for systems where drift assists particle transport.

Conclusion: 推导熵的最小化是生物和人工智能演化的支配原则，为设计下一代节能AI架构提供了严格的数学界限。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce stitched polar codes, a novel generalization of Arıkan's regular polar codes. Our core methodology reconfigures the fundamental polarization process by stitching additional structures to enhance the reliability of less reliable information bits in the original code. This approach preserves the polar transformation structure and maintains the same encoding and decoding complexity. Thanks to the flexible configuration, stitched polar codes consistently outperform regular polar codes, effectively solving the performance degradation issue in rate-matched scenarios. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on the weight spectrum and the polarization speed of stitched polar codes to prove their superiority.
