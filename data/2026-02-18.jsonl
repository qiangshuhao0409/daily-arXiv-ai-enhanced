However, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on analog semantic communication with simplified channel models. To bridge these gaps, we develop a robust vector quantized-enabled digital semantic communication (VQ-DSC-R) system built upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. Our work encompasses the framework design of VQ-DSC-R, followed by a comprehensive optimization study. Firstly, we design a Swin Transformer-based backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, integrated with VQ modules that map the features into a shared semantic quantized codebook (SQC) for efficient index transmission. Secondly, we propose a differentiable vector quantization with adaptive noise-variance (ANDVQ) scheme to mitigate quantization errors in SQC, which dynamically adjusts the quantization process using K-nearest neighbor statistics, while exponential moving average mechanism stabilizes SQC training. Thirdly, for robust index transmission over multipath fading channel and noise, we develop a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to refine channel state information, and design an attention-based module to dynamically adapt to channel noise. The entire VQ-DSC-R system is optimized via a three-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority of VQ-DSC-R over benchmark schemes, achieving high compression ratios and robust performance in practical scenarios."}

While the IoT sensors cover small areas and remain fixed, the UAVs can move between locations and cover larger areas, and the satellites can observe the entire region but have high latency and low reliability. We divide the deployment region into cells and model it as a graph, with the nodes representing individual cells and edges representing possible UAV mobility patterns. To evaluate the freshness of collected information from this graph, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) metric, measured separately for each cell. Under a given deployment of IoT nodes and UAV mobility patterns, our objective is to ascertain whether the system should actually utilize monitoring updates from satellites - a seemingly simple yet surprisingly elusive question. For stationary randomized scheduling policies, we develop closed-form expressions and lower bounds for the weighted-sum AoI and utilize this analysis to explore performance tradeoffs as system parameters vary. We also provide a Lyapunov style max-weight policy and detailed simulations that provide crucial insights for deploying such systems in practice."}

In practical systems, the channel Gram matrix can be estimated from received symbols and it provides realization-level information about channel subspace structure. The proposed method integrates a pre-trained angular-domain diffusion prior with two complementary guidance mechanisms: a novel Gram-matrix guidance term that enforces second-order consistency during the reverse diffusion process, and likelihood guidance from pilot observations. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-matched initialization and adaptive guidance scaling ensure stability and low inference latency. Simulations on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel models demonstrate consistent normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) improvements over deterministic diffusion baselines, achieving 4 to 6 dB SNR gains at an NMSE of 0.1 over the baseline in Fest et al.

In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness."}

Yet even when each component density is simple, the differential entropy of the mixture is notoriously hard to compute because the mixture couples a logarithm with a sum. This paper develops a deterministic, closed-form toolkit for bounding and accurately approximating mixture entropy directly from component parameters. Our starting point is an information-theoretic channel viewpoint: the latent mixture label plays the role of an input, and the observation is the output. This viewpoint separates mixture entropy into an average within-component uncertainty plus an overlap term that quantifies how much the observation reveals about the hidden label. We then bound and approximate this overlap term using pairwise overlap integrals between component densities, yielding explicit expressions whenever these overlaps admit a closed form. A simple, family-dependent offset corrects the systematic bias of the Jensen overlap bound and is calibrated to be exact in the two limiting regimes of complete overlap and near-perfect separation. A final clipping step guarantees that the estimate always respects universal information-theoretic bounds. Closed-form specializations are provided for Gaussian, factorized Laplacian, uniform, and hybrid mixtures, and numerical experiments validate the resulting bounds and approximations across separation, dimension, number of components, and correlated covariances."}

Accordingly, the 6G service providers are envisioned to play a crucial role in exposing AIaaS in a setting where users submit only an intent while the network helps in the intent-to-model matching (resolution) and execution placement under policy, trust, and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures."}

While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments."}

We introduce the AI Service Profile (ASP), a compact contract that expresses task modality and measurable service objectives (e.g., time-to-first-response/token, p99 latency, success probability) alongside privacy and mobility constraints. On this basis, we specify protocol-grade procedures for (i) DISCOVER (model/site discovery), (ii) AI PAGING (context-aware selection of execution anchor), (iii) two-phase PREPARE/COMMIT that atomically co-reserves compute and QoS resources, and (iv) make-before-break MIGRATION for session continuity.

We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless."}

However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms."}

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning."}

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks."}

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM."}

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."}

Existing uncertainty-based detectors can flag potential errors, but possibly be deceived and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents X-MAP, an eXplainable Misclassification Analysis and Profilling framework that reveals topic-level semantic patterns behind model failures. X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions. When used as a repair layer on base detectors, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage. These results demonstrate X-MAP's effectiveness and interpretability for improving spam and phishing detection."}

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning."}

To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary.

To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment."}

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations."}

We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint.

Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost."}

Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones.

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters."}

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control."}

When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE."}

To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state."}

We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study."}

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry."}

In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability.

The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures."}
