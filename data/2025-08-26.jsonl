Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a\nlarge R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To\naddress this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve\nunseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language\nmodels (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain\ndynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware\nfunctions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function\npool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query\npairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with\nboth GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks\noperating on real utility data."}

Our core idea lies in\nthe fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely\ndetermined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of\nwhich can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be\nspecific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable\nquantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the\nsame vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted\nfrom the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole\ntransition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same\nexperimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole\nresonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF\nmagnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent\nsensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the\nneed for spatial diversity or phase referencing.

To enhance effective data\nthroughput (i.e., Goodput) in PMCW-NOMA ISAC systems, we propose a deep\nlearning-based receiver architecture, termed two-timescale Transformer\n(T3former), which leverages a Transformer architecture to perform joint channel\nestimation and multi-user signal detection without the need for dedicated pilot\nsignals. By treating the deterministic structure of the PMCW waveform as an\nimplicit pilot, the proposed T3former eliminates the overhead associated with\ntraditional pilot-based methods. The proposed T3former processes the received\nPMCW-NOMA signals on two distinct timescales, where a fine-grained attention\nmechanism captures local features across the fast-time dimension, while a\ncoarse-grained mechanism aggregates global spatio-temporal dependencies of the\nslow-time dimension. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed T3former\nsignificantly outperforms traditional successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) receivers, which avoids inherent error propagation in SIC.

In many instances, it achieves performance levels that\nmatch or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less\ntime. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,\nwe engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the\nLLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem\ndomain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two\ncontrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,\nand code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM\nenables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while\nmaintaining significantly lower inference time."}

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has\nbeen less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF\nis a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To\nimprove the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,\nLLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for\nMAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained\ngraph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the\nfirst work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs\nwith the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior\nperformance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both\nsimulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems."}

We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent\nliterature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve\noptimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review\nquestions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,\nand prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted\nexperiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in\nautomatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.\nUsing a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:\nAct-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the\nobtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation\naccuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural\nlanguage and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations\nin accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate\nseveral future research directions, including structured datasets,\ndomain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular\nmulti-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

By employing distinct\nnotation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text\npairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the\ntextual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21\ncontemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision\nfrequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems\ncontaining semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is\nrelatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception\nfailures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures\nthat induce hallucinations.

Please refer to source code\n  available at: https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor", "summary": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

Despite their\nubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within\nbillions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture\nand cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by\nadopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and\ndeveloping a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM\narchitectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model\nanalysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that\nwhile LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in\nspecific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose\nemergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected\ncognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical\nresults highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill\nacquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions\nand neural plasticity.

However, the factors that drive this\nbrain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,\ntraining and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like\nrepresentations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers\n(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the\ninterplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural\nnetworks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising\nframework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual\nworld."}

Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust\nand comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and\naverage reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms\nfor computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or\nhard to implement.\n  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an\nordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$.
