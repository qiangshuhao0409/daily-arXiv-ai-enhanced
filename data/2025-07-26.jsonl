This undermines the receiver's ability to interpret transmitted\nrepresentations, thereby reducing overall system performance. To address this\nissue, we propose the Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE), a zero-shot, frame-based\nsemantic channel equalizer that aligns latent spaces of heterogeneous encoders\nwithout requiring system retraining. PFE enables dynamic signal compression and\nexpansion, mitigating semantic noise while preserving performance on downstream\ntasks. Building on this capability, we introduce a dynamic optimization\nstrategy that coordinates communication, computation, and learning resources to\nbalance energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) latency, and task performance in\nmulti-agent semantic communication scenarios. Extensive simulations confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach in maintaining semantic consistency and meeting\nlong-term constraints on latency and accuracy under diverse and time-varying\nnetwork conditions."}

In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly\nadvancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel\nreception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a\ndifferent subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by\nenabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on\nthe same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.\nAdditionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data\nfrom the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data\nparallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the\nset for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive\nconcurrency.

The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency.

We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator\nand aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance\nsubject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely\nthe Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to\nquantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter\nand the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal\ntransmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process\n(CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture\npolicy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies\nwith a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a\ntransmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both\nthe AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient\nconditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold\npolicy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors.\nLeveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm,\nInsec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead.\nOur results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields\nsignificantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric\nalone."}

We describe the methodology for mapping the\niterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose\ndifferent methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is\nproposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball\nwith a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for\nreinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to\nimprove the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list\ndecoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values\nthat substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism\ngroup of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose\na feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing\nhigh-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after\nthe existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of\nthe reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for\nthe Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel\n(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods."}

The privatizer ensures\nthe reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing\nthe minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models\ncases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their\ncombined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.\nThe privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate\nreconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing\nprinciples, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a\nconstrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven\ntraining procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and\nadversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios\nwhere optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are\nbenchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach."}
